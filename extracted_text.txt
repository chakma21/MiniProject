 visit CengageBrain.com or watch the dvd for the video program on Chapter 1, Theory and 
Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the 
brief lecturette for each chapter in this book prior to reading the chapter.
Where I Stand
My  philosophical  orientation  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  existential    
approach.  Because  this  approach  does  not  prescribe  a  set  of  techniques  and  pro-
cedures, I draw techniques from the other models of therapy that are presented in 
this  book.  I  particularly  like  to  use  role-playing  techniques.  When  people  reenact  
scenes  from  their  lives,  they  tend  to  become  more  psychologically  engaged  than  
when they merely report anecdotes about themselves. I also incorporate many tech-
niques derived from cognitive behavior therapy.
The psychoanalytic emphasis on early psychosexual and psychosocial develop-
ment is useful. Our past plays a crucial role in shaping our current personality and 
behavior. I challenge the deterministic notion that humans are the product of their 
early conditioning and, thus, are victims of their past. But I believe that an explora-
tion of the past is often useful, particularly to the degree that the past continues to 
influence present-day emotional or behavioral difficulties.
I value the cognitive behavioral focus on how our thinking affects the way we feel 
and behave. These therapies also emphasize current behavior. Thinking and feeling 
are important dimensions, but it can be a mistake to overemphasize them and not 
explore how clients are behaving. What people are doing often provides a good clue 
to what they really want. I also like the emphasis on specific goals and on encourag-
ing clients to formulate concrete aims for their own therapy sessions and in life.
More  approaches  have  been  developing  methods  that  involve  collaboration  
between therapist and client, making the therapeutic venture a shared responsibil-
ity. This collaborative relationship, coupled with teaching clients ways to use what 
they learn in therapy in their everyday lives, empowers clients to take an active stance 
in  their  world.  It  is  imperative  that  clients  be  active,  not  only  in  their  counseling  
sessions but in daily life as well. Homework, collaboratively designed by clients and 
therapists, can be a vehicle for assisting clients in putting into action what they are 
learning in therapy.
A related assumption of mine is that we can exercise increasing freedom to cre-
ate  our  own  future.  Accepting  personal  responsibility  does  not  imply  that  we  can  
be anything we want to be. Social, environmental, cultural, and biological realities 
oftentimes  limit  our  freedom  of  choice.  Being  able  to  choose  must  be  considered  
in  the  sociopolitical  contexts  that  exert  pressure  or  create  constraints;  oppression  
is a reality that can restrict our ability to choose our future. We are also influenced 
by our social environment, and much of our behavior is a product of learning and 
conditioning. That being said, I believe an increased awareness of these contextual 
forces enables us to address these realities. It is crucial to learn how to cope with the 
external and internal forces that influence our decisions and behavior.
Feminist therapy has contributed an awareness of how environmental and social 
conditions  contribute  to  the  problems  of  women  and  men  and  how  gender-role

socialization  leads  to  a  lack  of  gender  equality.  Family  therapy  teaches  us  that  it  is  
not possible to understand the individual apart from the context of the system. Both 
family therapy and feminist therapy are based on the premise that to understand the 
individual it is essential to take into consideration the interpersonal dimensions and 
the sociocultural context rather than focusing primarily on the intrapsychic domain. 
This comprehensive approach to counseling goes beyond understanding our internal 
dynamics and addresses the environmental and systemic realities that influence us.
My philosophy of counseling challenges the assumption that therapy is exclu-
sively  aimed  at  “curing”  psychological  “ailments.”  Such  a  focus  on  the  medical  
model restricts therapeutic practice because it stresses deficits rather than strengths. 
Instead,  I  agree  with  the  postmodern  approaches  (see  Chapter  13),  which  are  
grounded on the assumption that people have both internal and external resources 
to draw upon when constructing solutions to their problems. Therapists will view 
these  individuals  quite  differently  if  they  acknowledge  that  their  clients  possess  
competencies  rather  than  pathologies.  I  view  each  individual  as  having  resources  
and competencies that can be discovered and built upon in therapy.
Psychotherapy is a process of engagement between two people, both of whom 
are bound to change through the therapeutic venture. At its best, this is a collabora-
tive process that involves both the therapist and the client in co-constructing solu-
tions  regarding  life’s  tasks.  Most  of  the  theories  described  in  this  book  emphasize  
the collaborative nature of the practice of psychotherapy.
Therapists are not in business to change clients, to give them quick advice, or to 
solve their problems for them. Instead, counselors facilitate healing through a pro-
cess of genuine dialogue with their clients. The kind of person a therapist is remains 
the most critical factor affecting the client and promoting change. If practitioners 
possess wide knowledge, both theoretical and practical, yet lack human qualities of 
compassion, caring, good faith, honesty, presence, realness, and sensitivity, they are 
more like technicians. I believe that those who function exclusively as technicians do 
not make a significant difference in the lives of their clients. It is essential that coun-
selors explore their own values, attitudes, and beliefs in depth and work to increase 
their  own  awareness.  Throughout  the  book  I  encourage  you  to  find  ways  to  apply  
what  you  are  reading  to  your  personal  life.  Doing  so  will  take  you  beyond  a  mere  
academic understanding of these theories.
With  respect  to  mastering  the  techniques  of  counseling  and  applying  them  
appropriately  and  effectively,  it  is  my  belief  that  you  are  your  own  very  best  tech-
nique. Your engagement with your clients is useful in moving the therapeutic pro-
cess along. It is impossible to separate the techniques you use from your personality 
and the relationship you have with your clients.
Administering  techniques  to  clients  without  regard  for  the  relationship  vari-
ables  is  ineffective.  Techniques  cannot  substitute  for  the  hard  work  it  takes  to  
develop  a  constructive  client–therapist  relationship.  Although  you  can  learn  atti-
tudes and skills and acquire certain knowledge about personality dynamics and the 
therapeutic process, much of effective therapy is the product of artistry. Counseling 
entails far more than becoming a skilled technician. It implies that you are able to 
establish and maintain a good working relationship with your clients, that you can 
draw on your own experiences and reactions, and that you can identify techniques 
suited to the needs of your clients.

emotional, mental, social, cultural, political, and spiritual dimensions. If any one of 
these facets of human experience is neglected, a theory is limited in explaining how 
we think, feel, and act.
To  provide  you  with  a  consistent  framework  for  comparing  and  contrasting  
the various therapies, the 11 theory chapters share a common format. This format 
includes  a  few  notes  on  the  personal  history  of  the  founder  or  another  key  figure;  
a  brief  historical  sketch  showing  how  and  why  each  theory  developed  at  the  time  
it  did;  a  discussion  of  the  approach’s  key  concepts;  an  overview  of  the  therapeutic  
process, including the therapist’s role and client’s work; therapeutic techniques and 
procedures; applications of the theory from a multicultural perspective; application 
of the theory to the cases of Stan and Gwen; a summary; a critique of the theory with 
emphasis  on  contributions  and  limitations;  suggestions  of  how  to  continue  your  
learning about each approach; and suggestions for further reading.
Refer  to  the  Preface  for  a  complete  description  of  other  resources  that  fit  as  a  
package  and  complement  this  textbook,  including  Student  Manual  for  Theory  and  
Practice  of  Counseling  and  Psychotherapy  and  DVD  for  Integrative  Counseling:  The  Case  of  
Ruth and Lecturettes. In addition, in DVD for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psycho-
therapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes I demonstrate my way of counseling Stan from 
the various theoretical approaches in 13 sessions and present my perspective on the 
key concepts of each theory in a brief lecture, with emphasis on the practical applica-
tion of the theory.
Overview of the Theory Chapters
I  have  selected  11  therapeutic  approaches  for  this  book.  Table  1.1  presents  
an overview of these approaches, which are explored in depth in Chapters 4 through 
14. I have grouped these approaches into four general categories.
LO3
TabLe 1.1 Overview of Contemporary Counseling Models
Psychodynamic Approaches
Psychoanalytic therapyFounder: Sigmund Freud. A theory of personality development, a philosophy of human 
nature, and a method of psychotherapy that focuses on unconscious factors that motivate 
behavior. Attention is given to the events of the first six years of life as determinants of the 
later development of personality.
Adlerian therapyFounder: Alfred Adler. Key Figure: Following Adler, Rudolf Dreikurs is credited with 
popularizing this approach in the United States. This is a growth model that stresses 
assuming responsibility, creating one’s own destiny, and finding meaning and goals to create 
a purposeful life. Key concepts are used in most other current therapies.
Experiential and Relationship-Oriented Therapies
Existential therapyKey figures: Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, and Irvin Yalom. Reacting against the tendency to 
view therapy as a system of well-defined techniques, this model stresses building therapy 
on the basic conditions of human existence, such as choice, the freedom and responsibility 
to shape one’s life, and self-determination. It focuses on the quality of the person-to-person 
therapeutic relationship.

Person-centered therapyFounder: Carl Rogers; Key figure: Natalie Rogers. This approach was developed during the 
1940s as a nondirective reaction against psychoanalysis. Based on a subjective view of 
human experiencing, it places faith in and gives responsibility to the client in dealing with 
problems and concerns.
Gestalt therapyFounders: Fritz and Laura Perls; Key figures: Miriam and Erving Polster. An experiential 
therapy stressing awareness and integration; it grew as a reaction against analytic therapy. 
It integrates the functioning of body and mind and places emphasis on the therapeutic 
relationship.
Cognitive Behavioral Approaches
Behavior therapyKey figures: B. F. Skinner, and Albert Bandura. This approach applies the principles of 
learning to the resolution of specific behavioral problems. Results are subject to continual 
experimentation. The methods of this approach are always in the process of refinement. The 
mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches are rapidly gaining popularity.
Cognitive behavior therapyFounders: Albert Ellis and A. T. Beck. Albert Ellis founded rational emotive behavior therapy, 
a highly didactic, cognitive, action-oriented model of therapy, and A. T. Beck founded 
cognitive therapy, which gives a primary role to thinking as it influences behavior. Judith 
Beck continues to develop CBT; Christine Padesky has developed strengths-based CBT; 
and Donald Meichenbaum, who helped develop cognitive behavior therapy, has made 
significant contributions to resilience as a factor in coping with trauma.
Choice theory/Reality 
therapy
Founder: William Glasser. Key figure: Robert Wubbolding. This short-term approach is based 
on choice theory and focuses on the client assuming responsibility in the present. Through 
the therapeutic process, the client is able to learn more effective ways of meeting her or his 
needs.
Systems and Postmodern Approaches
Feminist therapyThis approach grew out of the efforts of many women, a few of whom are Jean Baker 
Miller, Carolyn Zerbe Enns, Oliva Espin, and Laura Brown. A central concept is the concern 
for the psychological oppression of women. Focusing on the constraints imposed by the 
sociopolitical status to which women have been relegated, this approach explores women’s 
identity development, self-concept, goals and aspirations, and emotional well-being.
Postmodern approachesA number of key figures are associated with the development of these various approaches 
to therapy. Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg are the cofounders of solution-focused brief 
therapy. Michael White and David Epston are the major figures associated with narrative 
therapy. Social constructionism, solution-focused brief therapy, and narrative therapy all 
assume that there is no single truth; rather, it is believed that reality is socially constructed 
through human interaction. These approaches maintain that the client is an expert in his or 
her own life.
Family systems therapyA number of significant figures have been pioneers of the family systems approach, two 
of whom include Murray Bowen and Virginia Satir. This systemic approach is based on the 
assumption that the key to changing the individual is understanding and working with the 
family.
First  are  the  psychodynamic  approaches.  Psychoanalytic  therapy  is  based  largely  on  
insight,  unconscious  motivation,  and  reconstruction  of  the  personality.  The  psy-
choanalytic  model  appears  first  because  it  has  had  a  major  influence  on  all  of  the  
formal systems of psychotherapy. Some of the therapeutic models are extensions of

psychoanalysis,  others  are  modifications  of  analytic  concepts  and  procedures,  and  
still others emerged as a reaction against psychoanalysis. Many theories of psycho-
therapy  have  borrowed  and  integrated  principles  and  techniques  from  psychoana-
lytic approaches.
Adlerian therapy differs from psychoanalytic theory in many respects, but it can 
broadly  be  considered  an  analytic  perspective.  Adlerians  focus  on  meaning,  goals,  
purposeful  behavior,  conscious  action,  belonging,  and  social  interest.  Although  
Adlerian theory accounts for present behavior by studying childhood experiences, it 
does not focus on unconscious dynamics.
The  second  category  comprises  the  experiential  and  relationship-oriented  therapies: 
the  existential  approach,  the  person-centered  approach,  and  Gestalt  therapy.  The  
existential approach stresses a concern for what it means to be fully human. It suggests 
certain themes that are part of the human condition, such as freedom and respon-
sibility, anxiety, guilt, awareness of being finite, creating meaning in the world, and 
shaping one’s future by making active choices. This approach is not a unified school 
of therapy with a clear theory and a systematic set of techniques. Rather, it is a philos-
ophy of counseling that stresses the divergent methods of understanding the subjec-
tive world of the person. The person-centered approach, which is rooted in a humanistic 
philosophy,  places  emphasis  on  the  basic  attitudes  of  the  therapist.  It  maintains  
that the quality of the client–therapist relationship is the prime determinant of the 
outcomes  of  the  therapeutic  process.  Philosophically,  this  approach  assumes  that  
clients have the capacity for self-direction without active intervention and direction 
on the therapist’s part. Another experiential approach is Gestalt therapy, which offers 
a range of experiments to help clients gain awareness of what they are experiencing 
in the here and now—that is, the present. In contrast to person-centered therapists, 
Gestalt therapists tend to take an active role, yet they follow the leads provided by 
their  clients.  These  approaches  tend  to  emphasize  emotion  as  a  route  to  bringing  
about change, and in a sense, they can be considered emotion-focused therapies.
Third  are  the  cognitive  behavioral  approaches,  sometimes  known  as  the  action-
oriented  therapies  because  they  all  emphasize  translating  insights  into  behavioral  
action.  These  approaches  include  choice  theory/reality  therapy,  behavior  therapy,  
rational emotive behavior therapy, and cognitive therapy. Reality therapy focuses on 
clients’ current behavior and stresses developing clear plans for new behaviors. Like 
reality therapy, behavior therapy puts a premium on doing and on taking steps to make 
concrete  changes.  A  current  trend  in  behavior  therapy  is  toward  paying  increased  
attention to cognitive factors as an important determinant of behavior. Rational emo-
tive  behavior  therapy  and  cognitive  therapy  highlight  the  necessity  of  learning  how  to  
challenge  inaccurate  beliefs  and  automatic  thoughts  that  lead  to  behavioral  prob-
lems.  These  cognitive  behavioral  approaches  are  used  to  help  people  modify  their  
inaccurate and self-defeating assumptions and to develop new patterns of acting.
The fourth general approach encompasses the systems and postmodern perspectives. 
Feminist  therapy  and  family  therapy  are  systems  approaches,  but  they  also  share  
postmodern  notions.  The  systems  orientation  stresses  the  importance  of  under-
standing individuals in the context of the surroundings that influence their devel-
opment.  To  bring  about  individual  change,  it  is  essential  to  pay  attention  to  how  
the individual’s personality has been affected by his or her gender-role socialization,

rate into a personalized style of counseling.
Intake Interview and Stan’s Autobiography
The setting is a community mental health agency where both individual and group 
counseling are available. Stan comes to counseling because of his drinking. He was 
convicted of driving under the influence, and the judge determined that he needed 
professional  help.  Stan  recognizes  that  he  does  have  problems,  but  he  is  not  con-
vinced that he is addicted to alcohol. Stan arrives for an intake interview and pro-
vides the counselor with this information:
At the present time I work in construction. I like building houses, but probably 
won’t stay in construction for the rest of my life. When it comes to my personal 
life,  I’ve  always  had  difficulty  in  getting  along  with  people.  I  could  be  called  a  
“loner.”  I  like  people  in  my  life,  but  I  don’t  seem  to  know  how  to  stay  close  to  
people. It probably has a lot to do with why I drink. I’m not very good at making 
friends or getting close to people. Probably the reason I sometimes drink a bit too 
much is because I’m so scared when it comes to socializing. Even though I hate 
to admit it, when I drink, things are not quite so overwhelming. When I look at 
others, they seem to know the right things to say. Next to them I feel dumb. I’m 
afraid that people don’t find me very interesting. I’d like to turn my life around, 
but I just don’t know where to begin. That’s why I went back to school. I’m a part-
time college student majoring in psychology. I want to better myself. In one of my 
classes,  Psychology  of  Personal  Adjustment,  we  talked  about  ourselves  and  how  
people change. We also had to write an autobiographical paper.
That  is  the  essence  of  Stan’s  introduction.  The  counselor  says  that  she  would  
like to read his autobiography. Stan hopes it will give her a better understanding of 
where he has been and where he would like to go. He brings her the autobiography, 
which reads as follows:
Where  am  I  currently  in  my  life?  At  35  I  feel  that  I’ve  wasted  most  of  my  life.  I  
should be finished with college and into a career by now, but instead I’m only a 
junior. I can’t afford to really commit myself to pursuing college full time because 
I need to work to support myself. Even though construction work is hard, I like 
the satisfaction I get when I look at what I have done.
I want to get into a profession where I could work with people. Someday, I’m 
hoping  to  get  a  master’s  degree  in  counseling  or  in  social  work  and  eventually  
work as a counselor with kids who are in trouble. I know I was helped by someone 
who cared about me, and I would like to do the same for someone else.
I  have  few  friends  and  feel  scared  around  most  people.  I  feel  good  with  
kids.  But  I  wonder  if  I’m  smart  enough  to  get  through  all  the  classes  I’ll  need  
to become a counselor. One of my problems is that I frequently get drunk. This 
happens when I feel alone and when I’m scared of the intensity of my feelings. At 
first drinking seemed to help, but later on I felt awful. I have abused drugs in the 
past also.
I  feel  overwhelmed  and  intimidated  when  I’m  around  attractive  women.  I  feel  
cold, sweaty, and terribly nervous. I think they may be judging me and see me as not

much  of  a  man.  I’m  afraid  I  just  don’t  measure  up  to  being  a  real  man.  When  I  am  
sexually  intimate  with  a  woman,  I  am  anxious  and  preoccupied  with  what  she  is  
thinking about me.
I feel anxiety much of the time. I often feel as if I’m dying inside. I think about 
committing suicide, and I wonder who would care. I can see my family coming to 
my funeral feeling sorry for me. I feel guilty that I haven’t worked up to my poten-
tial, that I’ve been a failure, that I’ve wasted much of my time, and that I let people 
down  a  lot.  I  get  down  on  myself  and  wallow  in  guilt  and  feel  very  depressed.  At  
times like this I feel hopeless and that I’d be better off dead. For all these reasons, 
I find it difficult to get close to anyone.
There are a few bright spots. I did put a lot of my shady past behind me, and 
did get into college. I like this determination in me—I want to change. I’m tired of 
feeling the way I do. I know that nobody is going to change my life for me. It’s up 
to me to get what I want. Even though I feel scared at times, I like that I’m willing 
to take risks.
What was my past like? A major turning point for me was the confidence my 
supervisor  had  in  me  at  the  youth  camp  where  I  worked  the  past  few  summers.  
He helped me get my job, and he also encouraged me to go to college. He said he 
saw a lot of potential in me for being able to work well with young people. That 
was hard for me to believe, but his faith inspired me to begin to believe in myself. 
Another  turning  point  was  my  marriage  and  divorce.  This  marriage  didn’t  last  
long. It made me wonder about what kind of man I was! Joyce was a strong and 
dominant woman who kept repeating how worthless I was and how she did not 
want to be around me. We had sex only a few times, and most of the time I was not 
very good at it. That was hard to take. It made me afraid to get close to a woman. 
My  parents  should  have  divorced.  They  fought  most  of  the  time.  My  mother  
(Angie) constantly criticized my father (Frank Sr.). I saw him as weak and passive. 
He would never stand up to her. There were four of us kids. My parents compared 
me  unfavorably  with  my  older  sister  (Judy)  and  older  brother  (Frank  Jr.).  They  
were  “perfect”  children,  successful  honors’  students.  My  younger  brother  (Karl)  
and I fought a lot. They spoiled him. It was all very hard for me.
In  high  school  I  started  using  drugs.  I  was  thrown  into  a  youth  rehabilita-
tion  facility  for  stealing.  Later  I  was  expelled  from  regular  school  for  fighting,  
and I landed in a continuation high school, where I went to school in the morn-
ings and had afternoons for on-the-job training. I got into auto mechanics, was  
fairly successful, and even managed to keep myself employed for three years as a 
mechanic.
I can still remember my father asking me: “Why can’t you be like your sister 
and brother? Why can’t you do anything right?” And my mother treated me much 
the way she treated my father. She would say: “Why do you do so many things to 
hurt me? Why can’t you grow up and be a man? Things are so much better around 
here when you’re gone.” I recall crying myself to sleep many nights, feeling terribly 
alone. There was no talk of religion in my house, nor was there any talk of sex. In 
fact, I find it hard to imagine my folks ever having sex.
Where would I like to be five years from now? What kind of person do I want 
to become? Most of all, I would like to start feeling better about myself. I would 
like to be able to stop drinking altogether and still feel good. I want to like myself 
much more than I do now. I hope I can learn to love at least a few other people,

most of all, a woman. I want to lose my fear of women. I would like to feel equal 
with others and not always have to feel apologetic for my existence. I want to let 
go of my anxiety and guilt. I want to become a good counselor for kids. I’m not 
certain how I’ll change or even what all the changes are I hope for. I do know that 
I want to be free of my self-destructive tendencies and learn how to trust people 
more. Perhaps when I begin to like myself more, I’ll be able to trust that others will 
find something about me to like.
Effective  therapists,  regardless  of  their  theoretical  orientation,  would  pay  
attention  to  suicidal  thoughts.  In  his  autobiography  Stan  says,  “I  think  about  
committing  suicide.”  At  times  he  doubts  that  he  will  ever  change  and  wonders  if  
he’d be “better off dead.” Before embarking on the therapeutic journey, the thera-
pist  would  need  to  make  an  assessment  of  Stan’s  current  ego  strength  (or  his  abil-
ity  to  manage  life  realistically),  which  would  include  a  discussion  of  his  suicidal  
thoughts.
Overview of Some Key Themes in Stan’s Life
A number of themes appear to represent core struggles in Stan’s life. Here are some 
of the statements we can assume that he may make at various points in his therapy 
and themes that will be addressed from the theoretical perspectives in Chapters 4 
through 15:
Although I’d like to have people in my life, I just don’t seem to know 
how to go about making friends or getting close to people.
I’d like to turn my life around, but I have no sense of direction.
I want to make a difference.
I am afraid of failure.
I know when I feel alone, scared, and overwhelmed, I drink heavily to 
feel better.
I am afraid of women.
Sometimes at night I feel a terrible anxiety and feel as if I’m dying.
I often feel guilty that I’ve wasted my life, that I’ve failed, and that I’ve 
let people down. At times like this, I get depressed.
I like it that I have determination and that I really want to change.
I’ve never really felt loved or wanted by my parents.
I’d like to get rid of my self-destructive tendencies and learn to trust 
people more.
I put myself down a lot, but I’d like to feel better about myself.
In the chapters in Part 2, I write about how I would apply selected concepts and 
techniques of the particular theory in counseling Stan. In addition, in these chapters 
you are asked to think about how you would continue counseling Stan from each 
of these different perspectives. In doing so, refer to the introductory material given 
here and to Stan’s autobiography as well. To make the case of Stan come alive for 
each theory, I highly recommend that you view and study the video program, DVD 
for  Theory  and  Practice  of  Counseling  and  Psychotherapy:  The  Case  of  Stan  and  Lecturettes. 
In this video program I counsel Stan from each of the various theories and provide 
brief lectures that highlight each theory.

Introduction to the Case of Gwen
Meet Dr. Kellie Kirksey
Background on the Case of Gwen
Gwen  is  a  56-year-old,  married  African  American  woman  presenting  with  
fibromyalgia,  difficulty  sleeping,  and  a  history  of  anxiety  and  depression.  She  
reports feeling stress and isolation on her job and is having a difficult time manag-
ing  her  multiple  roles.  Gwen  is  the  oldest  of  five  children,  and  after  her  parents’  
divorce, she took on the responsibility of caring for her younger siblings. Gwen has 
been married to Ron for 31 years and states they have ups and downs but basically 
their relationship is supportive. Ron is employed as a high school teacher and has 
always made the family a priority. They have three adult children, Brittany age 29, 
Lisa  age  26,  and  Kevin  age  23.  Gwen  has  a  master’s  degree  in  accounting  and  is  
employed at a large firm as a CPA. She reports being the only woman of color at her 
job. Because she is the only one speaking up for issues of diversity and racial equal-
ity at her workplace, she often feels isolated and tired. She does not have enough 
time to spend with friends or to do the things she once enjoyed because of her long 
work hours. Gwen also helps her adult children with their bills when needed and

I  invited  Dr.  Kellie  Kirksey  to  create  a  case  (“Gwen”)  
based on a composite of her clients over her many years 
of practice. Gwen’s concerns are discussed as they relate 
to  the  theory  featured  in  each  chapter,  and  Dr.  Kirksey  
demonstrates  how  she  would  work  with  Gwen  using  
techniques that illustrate key concepts from the theory.
Kellie  
n.  Kirksey,  PhD,  received  her  doctorate  in  
Counselor Education and Psychology at The Ohio State 
University. She is a licensed clinical counselor, a certified 
rehabilitation counselor, and an approved clinical super-
visor. She has practiced and taught in the counseling field 
for more than 25 years and has focused her work in the 
area of multicultural counseling, social justice, integrative counseling, and well-
ness. She was previously Associate Professor of Counselor Education at Malone 
University  in  Ohio  where  she  taught  practicum,  internship,  group  counseling,  
theories, and cultural diversity. She is currently a Holistic Psychotherapist at the 
Cleveland Clinic Center for Integrative Medicine and focuses primarily on using 
holistic  integrative  methods  such  as  hypnotherapy  and  meditation  for  health  
and wellness. She also has a part-time clinical practice in Ohio.
Dr.  Kirksey  is  a  contributor  to  Gerald  Corey’s  Case  Approach  to  Counseling  
and  Psychotherapy  text  in  which  she  works  with  Ruth  from  a  spiritually  focused  
integrative  perspective.  She  enjoys  exploring  how  wellness  is  achieved  in  other  
cultures and has given numerous workshops and presentations on wellness and 
self-care in North America, South Africa, Botswana, Hawaii, and Italy.

is the primary caretaker of her mother, who resides with her and is in the advanced 
stages of dementia.
This is Gwen’s first time in formal counseling. She reports having gone to her 
pastor  when  she  was  feeling  “down”  in  the  past.  Gwen  also  reports  times  of  being  
sexually molested by an older cousin. She seeks counseling because she is having dif-
ficulty staying focused at work and is generally feeling sad and overwhelmed. Gwen 
also reports experiencing a great deal of anxiety. She states she is not suicidal but is 
“sick  and  tired  of  feeling  sick  and  tired.”  Gwen  summarizes  her  current  situation  
by saying, “I realized the other day that I am tired of just existing and surviving. So 
here I am.” Gwen was referred to Dr. Kirksey by the pastor of her church. Despite the 
many challenges in her life, Gwen says that her faith in God is strong and church has 
always been her place of refuge.
Intake Session
Gwen  begins  by  saying  she  is  ready  to  unload  the  stressors  she  has  been  holding  
inside.  She  states  that  she  has  held  everything  together  for  everyone  far  too  long.  
During  this  initial  session,  I  also  address  the  relevant  aspects  of  informed  consent  
and  begin  an  ongoing  process  of  educating  Gwen  on  how  the  therapeutic  process  
works.
Gwen says she feels a heaviness in her heart, which is associated with all that is 
expected  of  her  at  work  and  with  her  family,  what  she  has  not  accomplished,  and  
where she is heading. I acknowledge this heaviness and ask her to start wherever she 
wants. Gwen states that she has not felt carefree since she was a young child before 
her parents’ divorce. Her parents moved to the North from Georgia for work when 
she  was  8  years  old.  Both  of  her  parents  were  teachers  and  valued  education.  Her  
neighborhood and school were predominantly African American, and the commu-
nity was close. In high school she was bussed across town to a predominately white 
school, and Gwen states she began to encounter what she felt were racist attitudes 
at this school. She reports:
I  felt  different  and  excluded  and  this  was  reinforced  by  occasional  name  calling  
and  subtle  slights.  That  was  one  of  the  first  times  I  remember  feeling  like  I  had  
to work twice as hard to get ahead and to be accepted in life. Throughout college 
I  worked  hard  to  be  successful  by  pushing  myself  to  achieve  what  people  said  I  
couldn’t, but it seems that all my hard work has just worn me down.
A  number  of  life  concerns  bring  Gwen  into  counseling.  A  few  of  her  concerns  
relate  to  her  work.  She  experiences  mounting  tension  on  the  job  and,  when  she  
asserts  her  opinions,  she  is  labeled  as  emotional  and  angry.  The  more  tension  she  
experiences  at  work,  the  less  she  engages  at  home.  An  additional  concern  is  that  
her mother is slowly fading into another world due to dementia. Gwen states she is 
feeling  terrible  about  herself  and  not  even  wanting  to  be  around  people  anymore.  
Everything irritates her and she prefers to spend time by herself.
Gwen reports the following:
I  feel  like  a  shell  of  a  person.  I  am  not  depressed  where  I  am  wanting  to  kill  
myself.  I  just  feel  numb.  There  is  no  real  point  to  doing  this  daily  routine  of  
waking, suffering through the day, and going to bed just to get up and do it all

over again. My life is like a flat note with little joy. I don’t go out; I don’t have sex; 
and I am too tired to do anything. Nothing I do is good enough. I start projects, 
and then it’s like they disappear. Nothing ever gets finished, and then I feel worse 
about myself. Sometimes I feel like I want to go into a cave and never come out. I 
feel like I will lose everything if I don’t make some changes in my life. Everything 
looks good on the outside, but inside of me, I am on edge and need to do some-
thing different. My pastor and mentor tell me I am sabotaging myself. Usually, I 
get defensive and withdrawn, but this time, I want to get better and I am ready to 
do what it takes. I am done with feeling tired all the time and hiding from people. 
My goal is to live a more balanced life and to learn how to reduce my stress level.
The  first  step  of  our  journey  is  to  build  a  working  alliance  based  on  mutual  
respect. I let Gwen know that this is her time to use as she pleases, and that it is a 
safe and confidential space.

18            CHAPTER TWO 
Introduction
One  of  the  most  important  instruments  you  have  to  work  with  as  a  counselor  is  
yourself as a person. In preparing for counseling, you will acquire knowledge about 
the  theories  of  personality  and  psychotherapy,  learn  assessment  and  intervention  
techniques,  and  discover  the  dynamics  of  human  behavior.  Such  knowledge  and  
skills  are  essential,  but  by  themselves  they  are  not  sufficient  for  establishing  and  
maintaining  effective  therapeutic  relationships.  To  every  therapy  session  we  bring  
our human qualities and the experiences that have influenced us. In my judgment, 
this  human  dimension  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  influences  on  the  therapeutic  
process.
A  good  way  to  begin  your  study  of  contemporary  counseling  theories  is  by  
reflecting  on  the  personal  issues  raised  in  this  chapter.  By  remaining  open  to  self-
evaluation, you not only expand your awareness of self but also build the foundation 
for developing your abilities and skills as a professional. The theme of this chapter is 
that the person and the professional are intertwined facets that cannot be separated in 
reality. We know, clinically and scientifically, that the person of the therapist and the 
therapeutic relationship contribute to therapy outcome at least as much as the par-
ticular treatment method used (Duncan, Miller, Wampold, & Hubble, 2010; Elkins, 
2016; Norcross, 2011).

Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the 
brief lecture for each chapter prior to reading the chapter.
The Counselor as a Therapeutic Person
Counseling  is  an  intimate  form  of  learning,  and  it  demands  a  practitio-
ner  who  is  willing  to  be  an  authentic  person  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.  It  is  
within  the  context  of  such  a  person-to-person  connection  that  the  client  experi-
ences growth. If we hide behind the safety of our professional role, our clients will 
likely keep themselves hidden from us. If we strive for technical expertise alone, and 
leave our own reactions and self out of our work, the result is likely to be ineffective 
counseling. Our own genuineness can have a significant effect on our relationship 
with our clients. If we are willing to look at our lives and make the changes we want, 
we can model that process by the way we reveal ourselves and respond to our clients. 
If  we  are  inauthentic,  we  will  have  difficulty  establishing  a  working  alliance  with  
our clients. If we model authenticity by engaging in appropriate self-disclosure, our 
clients will tend to be honest with us as well.
I believe that who the psychotherapist is directly relates to his or her ability to 
establish  and  maintain  effective  therapy  relationships  with  clients.  But  what  does  
the research reveal about the role of the counselor as a person and the therapeutic 
relationship on psychotherapy outcome? Abundant research indicates the centrality 
of the person of the therapist as a primary factor in successful therapy. The person of 
the psychotherapist is inextricably intertwined with the outcome of psychotherapy 
(see Elkins, 2016; Lambert, 2011; Norcross & Lambert, 2011; Norcross & Wampold, 
2011).  Clients  place  more  value  on  the  personality  of  the  therapist  than  on  the

specific  techniques  used.  Indeed,  evidence-based  psychotherapy  relationships  are  
critical to the psychotherapy endeavor.
Techniques  themselves  have  limited  importance  in  the  therapeutic  process.  
Wampold (2001) conducted a meta-analysis of many research studies on therapeu-
tic  effectiveness  and  found  that  the  personal  and  interpersonal  components  are  
essential  to  effective  psychotherapy,  whereas  techniques  have  relatively  little  effect  
on therapeutic outcome. The contextual factors—the alliance, the relationship, the per-
sonal and interpersonal skills of the therapist, client agency, and extra-therapeutic 
factors—are  the  primary  determinants  of  therapeutic  outcome.  This  research  sup-
ports what humanistic psychologists have maintained for years: “It is not theories 
and techniques that heal the suffering client but the human dimension of therapy 
and  the  ‘meetings’  that  occur  between  therapist  and  client  as  they  work  together”  
(Elkins,  2009,  p.  82).  In  short,  both  the  therapy  relationship  and  the  therapy  methods 
used  influence  the  outcomes  of  treatment,  but  it  essential  that  the  methods  used  
support the therapeutic relationship being formed with the client.
Personal Characteristics of Effective Counselors
Particular  personal  qualities  and  characteristics  of  counselors  are  significant  in  
creating  a  therapeutic  alliance  with  clients.  My  views  regarding  these  personal  
characteristics  are  supported  by  research  on  this  topic  (Norcross,  2011;  Skovholt  
&  Jennings,  2004;  Sperry  &  Carlson,  2011).  I  do  not  expect  any  therapist  to  fully  
exemplify all the traits described in the list that follows. Rather, the willingness to 
struggle  to  become  a  more  therapeutic  person  is  the  crucial  variable.  This  list  is  
intended  to  stimulate  you  to  examine  your  own  ideas  about  what  kind  of  person  
can make a significant difference in the lives of others.
Effective therapists have an identity. They know who they are, what they are 
capable of becoming, what they want out of life, and what is essential.
Effective therapists respect and appreciate themselves. They can give and 
receive help and love out of their own sense of self-worth and strength. 
They feel adequate with others and allow others to feel powerful  
with them.
Effective therapists are open to change. They exhibit a willingness and cour-
age to leave the security of the known if they are not satisfied with the 
way they are. They make decisions about how they would like to change, 
and they work toward becoming the person they want to become.
Effective therapists make choices that are life oriented. They are aware of early 
decisions they made about themselves, others, and the world. They are 
not the victims of these early decisions, and they are willing to revise 
them if necessary. They are committed to living fully rather than set-
tling for mere existence.
Effective therapists are authentic, sincere, and honest. They do not hide behind 
rigid roles or facades. Who they are in their personal life and in their 
professional work is congruent.
Effective therapists have a sense of humor. They are able to put the events of 
life in perspective. They have not forgotten how to laugh, especially at 
their own foibles and contradictions.

Effective therapists make mistakes and are willing to admit them. They do not 
dismiss their errors lightly, yet they do not choose to dwell on misery.
Effective therapists generally live in the present. They are not riveted to the 
past, nor are they fixated on the future. They are able to experience and 
be present with others in the “now.”
Effective therapists appreciate the influence of culture. They are aware of the 
ways in which their own culture affects them, and they respect the diver-
sity of values espoused by other cultures. They are sensitive to the unique 
differences arising out of social class, race, sexual orientation, and gender.
Effective therapists have a sincere interest in the welfare of others. This concern 
is based on respect, care, trust, and a real valuing of others.
Effective therapists possess effective interpersonal skills. They are capable of 
entering the world of others without getting lost in this world, and they 
strive to create collaborative relationships with others. They readily 
entertain another person’s perspective and can work together toward 
consensual goals.
Effective therapists become deeply involved in their work and derive meaning 
from it. They can accept the rewards flowing from their work, yet they 
are not slaves to their work.
Effective therapists are passionate. They have the courage to pursue their 
dreams and passions, and they radiate a sense of energy.
Effective therapists are able to maintain healthy boundaries. Although they 
strive to be fully present for their clients, they don’t carry the problems 
of their clients around with them during leisure hours. They know how 
to say no, which enables them to maintain balance in their lives.
This picture of the characteristics of effective therapists might appear unrealistic. 
Who could be all those things? Certainly I do not fit this bill! Do not think of these 
personal characteristics from an all-or-nothing perspective; rather, consider them on 
a continuum. A given trait may be highly characteristic of you, at one extreme, or it 
may be very uncharacteristic of you, at the other extreme. I have presented this pic-
ture  of  the  therapeutic  person  with  the  hope  that  you  will  examine  it  and  develop  
your  own  concept  of  what  personality  traits  you  think  are  essential  to  strive  for  to  
promote your own personal growth. For a more detailed discussion of the person of 
the counselor and the role of the therapeutic relationship in outcomes of treatments, 
see Psychotherapy Relationships That Work (Norcross, 2011), How Master Therapists Work: 
Exploring  Change  From  the  First  Through  the  Last  Session  and  Beyond  (Sperry  &  Carlson,  
2011), and Master Therapists: Exploring Expertise in Therapy and Counseling (Skovholt & 
Jennings, 2004).
Personal Therapy for the Counselor
Discussion  of  the  counselor  as  a  therapeutic  person  raises  another  issue  
debated in counselor education: Should people be required to participate in coun-
seling or therapy before they become practitioners? My view is that counselors can 
benefit greatly from the experience of being clients at some time, a view that is sup-
ported by research. This experience can be obtained before your training, during it,

or both, but I strongly support some form of self-exploration as vital preparation in 
learning to counsel others.
The  vast  majority  of  mental  health  professionals  have  experienced  personal  
therapy,  typically  on  several  occasions  (Geller,  Norcross,  &  Orlinsky,  2005b).  A  
review  of  research  studies  on  the  outcomes  and  impacts  of  the  psychotherapist’s  
own  psychotherapy  revealed  that  more  than  90%  of  mental  health  professionals  
report  satisfaction  and  positive  outcomes  from  their  own  counseling  experiences  
(Orlinsky,  Norcross,  Ronnestad,  &  Wiseman,  2005).  Orlinsky  and  colleagues  sug-
gest  that  personal  therapy  contributes  to  the  therapist’s  professional  work  in  the  
following three ways: (1) as part of the therapist’s training, personal therapy offers 
a model of therapeutic practice in which the trainee experiences the work of a more 
experienced therapist and learns experientially what is helpful or not helpful; (2) a 
beneficial experience in personal therapy can further enhance a therapist’s interper-
sonal skills that are essential to skillfully practicing therapy; and (3) successful per-
sonal therapy can contribute to a therapist’s ability to deal with the ongoing stresses 
associated with clinical work.
In  his  research  on  personal  therapy  for  mental  health  professionals,  Norcross  
(2005)  states  that  lasting  lessons  practitioners  learn  from  their  personal  therapy  
experiences pertain to interpersonal relationships and the dynamics of psychother-
apy.  Some  of  these  lessons  learned  are  the  centrality  of  warmth,  empathy,  and  the  
personal relationship; having a sense of what it is like to be a therapy client; valuing 
patience  and  tolerance;  and  appreciating  the  importance  of  learning  how  to  deal  
with  transference  and  countertransference.  By  participating  in  personal  therapy,  
counselors  can  prevent  their  potential  future  countertransference  from  harming  
clients.
Through our work as therapists, we can expect to confront our own unexplored 
personal  blocks  such  as  loneliness,  power,  death,  and  intimate  relationships.  This  
does not mean that we need to be free of conflicts before we can counsel others, but 
we should be aware of what these conflicts are and how they are likely to affect us 
as persons and as counselors. For example, if we have great difficulty dealing with 
anger or conflict, we may not be able to assist clients who are dealing with anger or 
with relationships in conflict.
When  I  began  counseling  others,  old  wounds  were  opened  and  feelings  I  had  
not explored in depth came to the surface. It was difficult for me to encounter a cli-
ent’s depression because I had failed to come to terms with the way I had escaped 
from my own depression. I did my best to cheer up depressed clients by talking them 
out of what they were feeling, mainly because of my own inability to deal with such 
feelings.  In  the  years  I  worked  as  a  counselor  in  a  university  counseling  center,  I  
frequently  wondered  what  I  could  do  for  my  clients.  I  often  had  no  idea  what,  if  
anything, my clients were getting from our sessions. I couldn’t tell if they were get-
ting better, staying the same, or getting worse. It was very important to me to note 
progress  and  see  change  in  my  clients.  Because  I  did  not  see  immediate  results,  I  
had many doubts about whether I could become an effective counselor. What I did 
not understand at the time was that my clients needed to struggle to find their own 
answers. To see my clients feel better quickly was my need, not theirs, for then I would 
know that I was helping them. It never occurred to me that clients often feel worse 
for a time as they give up their defenses and open themselves to their pain. My early

experiences as a counselor showed me that I could benefit by participating in further 
personal  therapy  to  better  understand  how  my  personal  issues  were  affecting  my  
professional  work.  I  realized  that  periodic  therapy,  especially  early  in  one’s  career,  
can be most useful.
Personal therapy can be instrumental in healing the healer. If student counsel-
ors are not actively involved in the pursuit of their own healing and growth, they will 
probably have considerable difficulty entering the world of a client. As counselors, 
can we take our clients any further than we have gone ourselves? If we are not com-
mitted personally to the value of examining our own life, how can we inspire clients 
to examine their lives? By becoming clients ourselves, we gain an experiential frame 
of reference with which to view ourselves. This provides a basis for understanding 
and compassion for our clients, for we can draw on our own memories of reaching 
impasses in our therapy, of both wanting to go farther and at the same time resisting 
change. Our own therapy can help us develop patience with our patients! We learn 
what it feels like to deal with anxieties that are aroused by self-disclosure and self-
exploration  and  how  to  creatively  facilitate  deeper  levels  of  self-exploration  in  cli-
ents. As we increase our self-awareness through our own therapy, we gain increased 
appreciation  for  the  courage  our  clients  display  in  their  therapeutic  journey.  Gold  
and  Hilsenroth  (2009)  studied  graduate  clinicians  and  found  that  those  who  had  
personal therapy felt more confident and were more in agreement with their clients 
on  the  goals  and  tasks  of  treatment  than  were  those  who  did  not  experience  per-
sonal therapy. They further found that graduate clinicians who had experienced per-
sonal therapy were able to develop strong agreement with their clients on the goals 
and  tasks  of  treatment.  Participating  in  a  process  of  self-exploration  can  reduce  
the  chances  of  assuming  an  attitude  of  arrogance  or  of  being  convinced  that  we  
are totally healed. Our own therapy helps us avoid assuming a stance of superiority 
over others and makes it less likely that we would treat people as objects to be pitied 
or  disrespected.  Indeed,  experiencing  counseling  as  a  client  is  very  different  from  
merely reading about the counseling process.
For a comprehensive discussion of personal therapy for counselors, see The Psy-
chotherapist’s  Own  Psychotherapy:  Patient  and  Clinician  Perspectives  (Geller,  Norcross,  &  
Orlinsky, 2005a).
The Counselor’s Values and the Therapeutic Process
As alluded to in the previous section, the importance of self-exploration for coun-
selors carries over to the values and beliefs we hold. My experience in teaching and 
supervising  students  of  counseling  shows  me  how  crucial  it  is  that  students  be  
aware of their values, of where and how they acquired them, and of how their values 
can influence their interventions with clients.
The Role of Values in Counseling
Our values are core beliefs that influence how we act, both in our personal 
and  our  professional  lives.  Personal  values  influence  how  we  view  counseling  and  
the manner in which we interact with clients, including the way we conduct client 
assessments, our views of the goals of counseling, the interventions we choose, the

topics  we  select  for  discussion  in  a  counseling  session,  how  we  evaluate  progress,  
and how we interpret clients’ life situations.
Although  total  objectivity  cannot  be  achieved,  we  can  strive  to  avoid  being  
encapsulated by our own worldview. We need to guard against the tendency to use 
our power to influence clients to accept our values; persuading clients to accept or 
adopt our value system is not a legitimate outcome of counseling. From my perspec-
tive,  the  counselor’s  role  is  to  create  a  climate  in  which  clients  can  examine  their  
thoughts,  feelings,  and  actions  and  to  empower  them  to  arrive  at  their  own  solu-
tions to problems they face. The counseling task is to assist individuals in finding 
answers that are most congruent with their own values. It is not beneficial to provide 
advice or to give clients your answers to their questions about life.
You may not agree with certain of your clients’ values, but you need to respect 
their right to hold divergent values from yours. This is especially true when coun-
seling  clients  who  have  a  different  cultural  background  and  perhaps  do  not  share  
your  own  core  cultural  values.  Your  role  is  to  provide  a  safe  and  inviting  environ-
ment  in  which  clients  can  explore  the  congruence  between  their  values  and  their  
behavior. If clients acknowledge that what they are doing is not getting them what 
they want, it is appropriate to assist them in developing new ways of thinking and 
behaving to help them move closer to their goals. This is done with full respect for 
their right to decide which values they will use as a framework for living. Individuals 
seeking counseling need to clarify their own values and goals, make informed deci-
sions,  choose  a  course  of  action,  and  assume  responsibility  and  accountability  for  
the decisions they make.
Managing your personal values so that they do not contaminate the counseling 
process is referred to as “bracketing.” Counselors are expected to set aside their per-
sonal beliefs and values when working with a wide range of clients (Kocet & Herlihy, 
2014). Your core values may differ in many ways from the core values of your clients, 
and  they  will  bring  you  a  host  of  problems  framed  by  their  own  worldview.  Some  
clients  may  have  felt  rejected  by  others  or  suffered  from  discrimination,  and  they  
should not be exposed to further discrimination by counselors who refuse to render 
services to them because of differing values (Herlihy, Hermann, & Greden, 2014).
Counselors  must  have  the  ability  to  work  with  a  range  of  clients  with  diverse  
worldviews and values. Counselors may impose their values either directly or indi-
rectly. 
value imposition refers to counselors directly attempting to define a client’s 
values,  attitudes,  beliefs,  and  behaviors.  It  is  unethical  for  counselors  to  impose  
their values in the therapeutic relationship. The American Counseling Association’s 
(ACA, 2014) Code of Ethics is explicit regarding this matter:
Personal Values. Counselors are aware of—and avoid imposing—their own values, atti-
tudes,  beliefs,  and  behaviors.  Counselors  respect  the  diversity  of  clients,  trainees,  
and  research  participants  and  seek  training  in  areas  in  which  they  are  at  risk  of  
imposing their values onto clients, especially when the counselor’s values are incon-
sistent with the client’s goals or are discriminatory in nature. (Standard A.4.b.)
Value  exploration  is  at  the  heart  of  why  many  counselor  education  programs  
encourage  or  require  personal  therapy  for  counselors  in  training.  Your  personal  
therapy sessions provide an opportunity for you to examine your beliefs and values 
and to explore your motivations for wanting to share your belief system.

Clients  are  in  a  vulnerable  position  and  require  understanding  and  support  
from  a  counselor  rather  than  judgment.  It  can  be  burdensome  for  clients  to  be  
saddled with your disclosure of not being able to get beyond value differences. Cli-
ents may interpret this as a personal rejection and suffer harm as a result. Coun-
seling is about working with clients within the framework of their value system. If 
you experience difficulties over conflicting personal values with clients, the ethical 
course of action is to seek supervision and learn ways to effectively manage these 
differences. The counseling process is not about your personal values; it is about 
the values and needs of your clients. Your task is to help clients explore and clarify 
their  beliefs  and  apply  their  values  to  solving  their  problems  (Herlihy  &  Corey,  
2015d).
The Role of Values in Developing Therapeutic Goals
Who  should  establish  the  goals  of  counseling?  Almost  all  theories  are  in  
agreement that it is largely the client’s responsibility to decide upon goals, collabo-
rating with the therapist as therapy proceeds. Counselors have general goals, which 
are  reflected  in  their  behavior  during  the  therapy  session,  in  their  observations  of  
the client’s behavior, and in the interventions they make. The general goals of coun-
selors must be congruent with the personal goals of the client.
Setting goals is inextricably related to values. The client and the counselor need 
to  explore  what  they  hope  to  obtain  from  the  counseling  relationship,  whether  
they can work with each other, and whether their goals are compatible. Even more 
important, it is essential that the counselor be able to understand, respect, and work 
within the framework of the client’s world rather than forcing the client to fit into 
the therapist’s scheme of values.
In my view, therapy ought to begin with an exploration of the client’s expec-
tations  and  goals.  Clients  initially  tend  to  have  vague  ideas  of  what  they  expect  
from therapy. They may be seeking solutions to problems, they may want to stop 
hurting, they may want to change others so they can live with less anxiety, or they 
may seek to be different so that some significant persons in their lives will be more 
accepting of them. In some cases clients have no goals; they are in the therapist’s 
office  simply  because  they  were  sent  for  counseling  by  their  parents,  probation  
officer, or teacher.
So  where  can  a  counselor  begin?  The  initial  interview  can  be  used  most  pro-
ductively to focus on the client’s goals or lack of them. The therapist may begin by 
asking any of these questions: “What do you expect from counseling? Why are you 
here? What do you want? What do you hope to leave with? How is what you are cur-
rently doing working for you? What aspects of yourself or your life situation would 
you most like to change?”
When a person seeks a counseling relationship with you, it is important to coop-
eratively discover what this person is expecting from the relationship. If you try to 
figure out in advance how to proceed with a client, you may be depriving the client 
of  the  opportunity  to  become  an  active  partner  in  her  or  his  own  therapy.  Why  is  
this person coming in for counseling? It is the client’s place to decide on the goals 
of therapy. It is important to keep this focus in mind so that the client’s agenda is 
addressed rather than an agenda of your own.

Becoming an Effective Multicultural Counselor
Part of the process of becoming an effective counselor involves learning how 
to recognize diversity issues and shaping one’s counseling practice to fit the client’s 
worldview. It is an ethical obligation for counselors to develop sensitivity to cultural 
differences  if  they  hope  to  make  interventions  that  are  consistent  with  the  values  
of their clients. The therapist’s role is to assist clients in making decisions that are 
congruent with their worldview, not to live by the therapist’s values.
Diversity in the therapeutic relationship is a two-way street. As a counselor, you 
bring your own heritage with you to your work, so you need to recognize the ways in 
which cultural conditioning has influenced the directions you take with your clients. 
Unless the social and cultural context of clients and counselors are taken into consid-
eration, it is difficult to appreciate the nature of clients’ struggles. Counseling students 
often hold values—such as making their own choices, expressing what they are feeling, 
being open and self-revealing, and striving for independence—that differ from the val-
ues of clients from different cultural backgrounds. Some clients may be very slow to 
disclose  and  have  expectations  about  counseling  that  differ  from  those  of  therapist.  
Counselors need to become aware of how clients from diverse cultures may perceive 
them as therapists, as well as how clients may perceive the value of formal helping. It 
is the task of counselors to determine whether the assumptions they have made about 
the nature and functioning of therapy are appropriate for culturally diverse clients.
Clearly, effective counseling must take into account the impact of culture on the 
client’s functioning, including the client’s degree of acculturation. 
culture is, quite 
simply, the values and behaviors shared by a group of individuals. It is important to 
realize that culture refers to more than ethnic or racial heritage; culture also includes 
factors such as age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical and mental ability, 
and socioeconomic status.
Acquiring Competencies in Multicultural Counseling
Effective counselors understand their own cultural conditioning, the cultural 
values of their clients, and the sociopolitical system of which they are a part. Acquir-
ing  this  understanding  begins  with  counselors’  awareness  of  the  cultural  origins  
of  any  values,  biases,  and  attitudes  they  may  hold.  Counselors  from  all  cultural  
groups must examine their expectations, attitudes, biases, and assumptions about 
the  counseling  process  and  about  persons  from  diverse  groups.  Recognizing  our  
biases and prejudices takes courage because most of us do not want to acknowledge 
that we have cultural biases. Everyone has biases, but being unaware of the biased 
attitudes we hold is an obstacle to client care. It takes a concerted effort and vigi-
lance to monitor our biases, attitudes, and values so that they do not interfere with 
establishing and maintaining successful counseling relationships.
A major part of becoming a diversity-competent counselor involves challenging 
the idea that the values we hold are automatically true for others. We also need to 
understand how our values are likely to influence our practice with diverse clients 
who embrace different values. Furthermore, becoming a diversity-competent practi-
tioner is not a destination that we arrive at once and for all; rather, it is an ongoing 
process, a journey we take with our clients.

26            CHAPTER TWO 
Sue, Arredondo, and McDavis (1992) and Arredondo and her colleagues (1996) 
have developed a conceptual framework for competencies and standards in multi-
cultural counseling. Their dimensions of competency involve three areas: (1) beliefs 
and attitudes, (2) knowledge, and (3) skills. For an in-depth treatment of multicul-
tural  counseling  and  therapy  competence,  refer  to  Counseling  the  Culturally  Diverse:  
Theory and Practice (Sue & Sue, 2013).
Beliefs and Attitudes First, effective counselors have moved from being culturally 
unaware to ensuring that their personal biases, values, or problems will not interfere 
with their ability to work with clients who are culturally different from them. They 
believe  cultural  self-awareness  and  sensitivity  to  one’s  own  cultural  heritage  are  
essential for any form of helping. Counselors are aware of their positive and negative 
emotional  reactions  toward  people  from  other  racial  and  ethnic  groups  that  may  
prove detrimental to establishing collaborative helping relationships. They seek to 
examine  and  understand  the  world  from  the  vantage  point  of  their  clients.  They  
respect clients’ religious and spiritual beliefs and values. They are comfortable with 
differences between themselves and others in terms of race, ethnicity, culture, and 
beliefs.  Rather  than  maintaining  that  their  cultural  heritage  is  superior,  they  are  
able to accept and value cultural diversity. They realize that traditional theories and 
techniques  may  not  be  appropriate  for  all  clients  or  for  all  problems.  Culturally  
skilled  counselors  monitor  their  functioning  through  consultation,  supervision,  
and further training or education.
Knowledge  Second,  culturally  effective  practitioners  possess  certain  knowledge.  
They  know  specifically  about  their  own  racial  and  cultural  heritage  and  how  it  
affects them personally and professionally. Because they understand the dynamics of 
oppression, racism, discrimination, and stereotyping, they are in a position to detect 
their  own  racist  attitudes,  beliefs,  and  feelings.  They  understand  the  worldview  
of  their  clients,  and  they  learn  about  their  clients’  cultural  background.  They  do  
not  impose  their  values  and  expectations  on  their  clients  from  differing  cultural  
backgrounds and avoid stereotyping clients. Culturally skilled counselors understand 
that  external  sociopolitical  forces  influence  all  groups,  and  they  know  how  these  
forces  operate  with  respect  to  the  treatment  of  minorities.  These  practitioners  are  
aware of the institutional barriers that prevent minorities from utilizing the mental 
health  services  available  in  their  communities.  They  possess  knowledge  about  the  
historical  background,  traditions,  and  values  of  the  client  populations  with  whom  
they  work.  They  know  about  minority  family  structures,  hierarchies,  values,  and  
beliefs. Furthermore, they are knowledgeable about community characteristics and 
resources.  Those  who  are  culturally  skilled  know  how  to  help  clients  make  use  of  
indigenous  support  systems.  In  areas  where  they  are  lacking  in  knowledge,  they  
seek resources to assist them. The greater their depth and breadth of knowledge of 
culturally diverse groups, the more likely they are to be effective practitioners.
Skills and Intervention Strategies Third, effective counselors have acquired certain 
skills in working with culturally diverse populations. Counselors take responsibility 
for  educating  their  clients  about  the  therapeutic  process,  including  matters  such  as  
setting goals, appropriate expectations, legal rights, and the counselor’s orientation.

Multicultural counseling is enhanced when practitioners use methods and strategies 
and  define  goals  consistent  with  the  life  experiences  and  cultural  values  of  their  
clients.  Such  practitioners  modify  and  adapt  their  interventions  to  accommodate  
cultural  differences.  They  do  not  force  their  clients  to  fit  within  one  counseling  
approach,  and  they  recognize  that  counseling  techniques  may  be  culture-bound.  
They are able to send and receive both verbal and nonverbal messages accurately and 
appropriately. They become actively involved with minority individuals outside the 
office (community events, celebrations, and neighborhood groups). They are willing 
to  seek  out  educational,  consultative,  and  training  experiences  to  enhance  their  
ability to work with culturally diverse client populations. They consult regularly with 
other multiculturally sensitive professionals regarding issues of culture to determine 
whether referral may be necessary.
Incorporating Culture in Counseling Practice
It is unrealistic to expect a counselor to know everything about the cultural back-
ground of a client, but some understanding of the client’s cultural and ethnic back-
ground  is  essential.  There  is  much  to  be  said  for  letting  clients  teach  counselors  
about relevant aspects of their culture. It is a good idea for counselors to ask clients 
to provide them with the information they will need to work effectively. Incorporat-
ing culture into the therapeutic process is not limited to working with clients from a 
certain ethnic or cultural background. It is critical that therapists take into account 
the worldview and background of every client. Failing to do this seriously restricts 
the potential impact of the therapeutic endeavor.
Counseling is by its very nature diverse in a multicultural society, so it is easy to 
see that there are no ideal therapeutic approaches. Instead, different theories have 
distinct  features  that  have  appeal  for  different  cultural  groups.  Some  theoretical  
approaches  have  limitations  when  applied  to  certain  populations.  Effective  multi-
cultural practice demands an open stance on the part of the practitioner, flexibility, 
and a willingness to modify strategies to fit the needs and the situation of the indi-
vidual  client.  Practitioners  who  truly  respect  their  clients  will  be  aware  of  clients’  
hesitations and will not be too quick to misinterpret this behavior. Instead, they will 
patiently attempt to enter the world of their clients as much as they can. Although 
practitioners  may  not  have  had  the  same  experiences  as  their  clients,  the  empathy  
shown  by  counselors  for  the  feelings  and  struggles  of  their  clients  is  essential  to  
good therapeutic outcomes. We are more often challenged by our differences than 
by our similarities to look at what we are doing.
Practical  Guidelines  in  Addressing  Culture  If  the  counseling  process  is  to  be  
effective,  it  is  essential  that  cultural  concerns  be  addressed  with  all  clients.  Here  
are some guidelines that may increase your effectiveness when working with clients 
from diverse backgrounds:
Learn more about how your own cultural background has influenced 
your thinking and behaving. Take steps to increase your understanding 
of other cultures.
Identify your basic assumptions, especially as they apply to diversity  
in culture, ethnicity, race, gender, class, spirituality, religion, and

sexual orientation. Think about how your assumptions are likely to 
affect your professional practice.
Examine where you obtained your knowledge about culture.
Remain open to ongoing learning of how the various dimensions of 
culture may affect therapeutic work. Realize that this skill does not 
develop quickly or without effort.
Be willing to identify and examine your own personal worldview and 
any prejudices you may hold about other racial/ethnic groups.
Learn to pay attention to the common ground that exists among peo-
ple of diverse backgrounds.
Be flexible in applying the methods you use with clients. Don’t be wed-
ded to a specific technique if it is not appropriate for a given client.
Remember that practicing from a multicultural perspective can make 
your job easier and can be rewarding for both you and your clients.
It takes time, study, and experience to become an effective multicultural coun-
selor. Multicultural competence cannot be reduced simply to cultural awareness and 
sensitivity, to a body of knowledge, or to a specific set of skills. Instead, it requires a 
combination of all of these factors.
Issues Faced by Beginning Therapists
When you complete formal course work and begin helping clients, you will 
be challenged to integrate and to apply what you have learned. At that point, you are 
likely to have some real concerns about your adequacy as a person and as a profes-
sional. Beginning therapists typically face a number of common issues as they learn 
how to help others. Here are some useful guidelines to assist you in your reflection 
on what it takes to become an effective counselor.
Dealing With Anxiety
Most  beginning  counselors  have  ambivalent  feelings  when  meeting  their  first  cli-
ents. A certain level of anxiety demonstrates that you are aware of the uncertainties 
of  the  future  with  your  clients  and  of  your  abilities  to  really  be  there  for  them.  A  
willingness to recognize and deal with these anxieties, as opposed to denying them, 
is a positive sign. That we have self-doubts is normal; it is how we deal with them 
that  matters.  One  way  is  to  openly  discuss  our  self-doubts  with  a  supervisor  and  
peers. The possibilities are rich for meaningful exchanges and for gaining support 
from fellow interns who probably have many of the same concerns and anxieties.
Being Yourself and Self-Disclosure
If you feel self-conscious and anxious when you begin counseling, you may have a 
tendency to be overly concerned with what the books say and with the mechanics 
of how to proceed. Inexperienced therapists too often fail to appreciate the values 
inherent  in  simply  being  themselves.  If  we  are  able  to  be  ourselves  in  our  thera-
peutic  work,  and  appropriately  disclose  our  reactions  in  counseling  sessions,  we  
increase the chances of being authentic. It is this level of genuineness and presence

that enables us to connect with our clients and to establish an effective therapeutic 
relationship with them.
It is possible to err by going to extremes in two different directions. At one end 
are counselors who lose themselves in their fixed role and hide behind a professional 
facade. These counselors are so caught up in maintaining stereotyped role expecta-
tions  that  little  of  their  personal  self  shows  through.  Counselors  who  adopt  this  
behavior will likely remain anonymous to clients, and clients may perceive them as 
hiding behind a professional role.
At the other end of the spectrum is engaging in too much self-disclosure. Some 
counselors make the mistake of inappropriately burdening their clients with their 
spontaneous  impressions  about  their  clients.  Judging  the  appropriate  amount  of  
self-disclosure can be a problem even for seasoned counselors, and it is often espe-
cially  worrisome  for  new  counselors.  In  determining  the  appropriateness  of  self-
disclosure, consider what to reveal, when to reveal, and how much to reveal. It may be 
useful  to  mention  something  about  ourselves  from  time  to  time,  but  we  must  be  
aware of our motivations for making ourselves known in this way. Assess the readi-
ness of a client to hear these disclosures as well as the impact doing so might have 
on the client. Remain observant during any self-disclosure to get a sense of how the 
client is being affected by it.
The most productive form of self-disclosure is related to what is going on between 
the  counselor  and  the  client  within  the  counseling  session.  The  skill  of  immediacy  
involves revealing what we are thinking or feeling in the here and now with the cli-
ent,  but  be  careful  to  avoid  pronouncing  judgments  about  the  client.  When  done  
in  a  timely  way,  sharing  persistent  reactions  can  facilitate  therapeutic  progress  and  
improve  the  quality  of  our  relationship  with  the  client.  Even  when  we  are  talking  
about reactions based on the therapeutic relationship, caution is necessary, and dis-
cretion and sensitivity are required in deciding what reactions we might share.
Avoiding Perfectionism
Perhaps one of the most common self-defeating beliefs with which we burden our-
selves is that we must never make a mistake. Although we may well know intellectu-
ally that humans are not perfect, emotionally we often feel that there is little room for 
error. To be sure, you will make mistakes, whether you are a beginning or a seasoned 
therapist.  If  our  energies  are  tied  up  presenting  an  image  of  perfection,  this  will  
affect our ability to be present for our clients. I tell students to question the notion 
that  they  should  know  everything  and  be  perfectly  skilled.  I  encourage  them  to  
share their mistakes or what they perceive as errors during their supervision meet-
ings. Students willing to risk making mistakes in supervised learning situations and 
willing to reveal their self-doubts will find a direction that leads to growth.
Being Honest About Your Limitations
You cannot realistically expect to succeed with every client. It takes honesty to admit 
that you cannot work successfully with every client. It is important to learn when and 
how  to  make  a  referral  for  clients  when  your  limitations  prevent  you  from  helping  
them. However, there is a delicate balance between learning your realistic limits and 
challenging what you sometimes think of as being “limits.” Before deciding that you

do not have the life experiences or the personal qualities to work with a given popu-
lation, try working in a setting with a population you do not intend to specialize in. 
This can be done through diversified field placements or visits to agencies.
Understanding Silence
Silent moments during a therapeutic session may seem like silent hours to a begin-
ning therapist, yet this silence can have many meanings. The client may be quietly 
thinking about some things that were discussed earlier or evaluating some insight 
just acquired. The client may be waiting for the therapist to take the lead and decide 
what to say next, or the therapist may be waiting for the client to do this. Either the 
client or the therapist may be distracted or preoccupied, or neither may have any-
thing to say for the moment. The client and the therapist may be communicating 
without words. The silence may be refreshing, or the silence may be overwhelming. 
Perhaps the interaction has been on a surface level, and both persons have some fear 
or hesitancy about getting to a deeper level. When silence occurs, acknowledge and 
explore with your client the meaning of the silence.
Dealing With Demands From Clients
A major issue that puzzles many beginning counselors is how to deal with clients 
who  seem  to  make  constant  demands.  Because  therapists  feel  they  should  extend  
themselves in being helpful, they often burden themselves with the unrealistic idea 
that they should give unselfishly, regardless of how great clients’ demands may be. 
These demands may manifest themselves in a variety of ways. Clients may want to 
see you more often or for a longer period than you can provide. They may want to 
see you socially. Some clients may expect you to continually demonstrate how much 
you care or demand that you tell them what to do and how to solve a problem. One 
way  of  heading  off  these  demands  is  to  make  your  expectations  and  boundaries  
clear during the initial counseling sessions or in the disclosure statement.
Dealing With Clients Who Lack Commitment
Involuntary  clients  may  be  required  by  a  court  order  to  obtain  therapy,  and  you  
may be challenged in your attempt to establish a working relationship with them. 
It  is  possible  to  do  effective  work  with  mandated  clients,  but  practitioners  must  
begin  by  openly  discussing  the  nature  of  the  relationship.  Counselors  who  omit  
preparation  and  do  not  address  clients’  thoughts  and  feelings  about  coming  to  
counseling are likely to encounter resistance. It is critical that therapists not prom-
ise what they cannot or will not deliver. It is good practice to make clear the limits 
of confidentiality as well as any other factors that may affect the course of therapy. 
In working with involuntary clients, it is especially important to prepare them for 
the process; doing so can go a long way toward increasing their cooperation and 
involvement.
Tolerating Ambiguity
Many beginning therapists experience the anxiety of not seeing immediate results. 
They ask themselves: “Am I really doing my client any good? Is the client perhaps

getting worse?” I hope you will learn to tolerate the ambiguity of not knowing for 
sure  whether  your  client  is  improving,  at  least  during  the  initial  sessions.  Realize  
that  oftentimes  clients  may  seemingly  “get  worse”  before  they  show  therapeutic  
gains. Also, realize that the fruitful effects of the joint efforts of the therapist and 
the client may manifest themselves after the conclusion of therapy.
Becoming Aware of Your Countertransference
Working with clients can affect you in personal ways, and your own vulnerabilities 
and countertransference are bound to surface. If you are unaware of your personal 
dynamics,  you  are  in  danger  of  being  overwhelmed  by  a  client’s  emotional  expe-
riences.  Beginning  counselors  need  to  learn  how  to  “let  clients  go”  and  not  carry  
around their problems until the next session. The most therapeutic thing is to be as 
fully present as we are able to be during the therapy hour, but to let clients assume 
the responsibility of their living and choosing outside of the session. If we become 
lost  in  clients’  struggles  and  confusion,  we  cease  being  effective  agents  in  helping  
them  find  solutions  to  their  problems.  If  we  accept  responsibility  for  our  clients’  
decisions, we are blocking rather than fostering their growth.
countertransference,  defined  broadly,  includes  any  of  our  projections  that  
influence the way we perceive and react to a client. This phenomenon occurs when 
we  are  triggered  into  emotional  reactivity,  when  we  respond  defensively,  or  when  
we  lose  our  ability  to  be  present  in  a  relationship  because  our  own  issues  become  
involved. Recognizing the manifestations of our countertransference reactions is an 
essential  step  in  becoming  competent  counselors.  Unless  we  are  aware  of  our  own  
conflicts, needs, assets, and liabilities, we can use the therapy hour more for our own 
purposes than for being available for our clients. Because it is not appropriate for us 
to use clients’ time to work through our reactions to them, it is all the more impor-
tant that we be willing to work on ourselves in our own sessions with another thera-
pist, supervisor, or colleague. If we do not engage in this kind of self-exploration, we 
increase  the  danger  of  losing  ourselves  in  our  clients  and  using  them  to  meet  our  
unfulfilled needs.
The emotionally intense relationships we develop with clients can be expected to 
tap into our own unresolved problem areas. Our clients’ stories and pain are bound 
to have an impact on us; we will be affected by their stories and can express compas-
sion and empathy. However, we have to realize that it is their pain and not carry it 
for them lest we become overwhelmed by their life stories and thus render ourselves 
ineffective  in  working  with  them.  Although  we  cannot  completely  free  ourselves  
from  any  traces  of  countertransference  or  ever  fully  resolve  all  personal  conflicts  
from the past, we can become aware of ways these realities influence our professional 
work.  Our  personal  therapy  can  be  instrumental  in  enabling  us  to  recognize  and  
manage our countertransference reactions. (This topic is explored in more depth in 
Chapter 4.)
Developing a Sense of Humor
Therapy is a responsible endeavor, but it need not be deadly serious. Both clients and 
counselors can enrich a relationship through humor. What a welcome relief when 
we  can  admit  that  pain  is  not  our  exclusive  domain.  It  is  important  to  recognize

that laughter or humor does not mean that clients are not respected or work is not 
being accomplished. There are times, of course, when laughter is used to cover up 
anxiety or to escape from the experience of facing threatening material. The thera-
pist needs to distinguish between humor that distracts and humor that enhances 
the situation.
Sharing Responsibility With the Client
You  might  struggle  with  finding  the  optimum  balance  in  sharing  responsibility  
with your clients. One mistake is to assume full responsibility for the direction and 
outcomes of therapy. This will lead to taking from your clients their rightful respon-
sibility of making their own decisions. It could also increase the likelihood of your 
early burnout. Another mistake is for you to refuse to accept the responsibility for 
making accurate assessments and designing appropriate treatment plans for your 
clients. How responsibility will be shared should be addressed early in the course of 
counseling.  It  is  your  responsibility  to  discuss  specific  matters  such  as  length  and  
overall duration of the sessions, confidentiality, general goals, and methods used to 
achieve goals. (Informed consent is discussed in Chapter 3.)
It is important to be alert to your clients’ efforts to get you to assume responsi-
bility for directing their lives. Many clients seek a “magic answer” as a way of escaping 
the anxiety of making their own decisions. It is not your role to assume responsibil-
ity  for  directing  your  clients’  lives.  Collaboratively  designing  contracts  and  home-
work assignments with your clients can be instrumental in your clients’ increasingly 
finding direction within themselves. Perhaps the best measure of our effectiveness 
as counselors is the degree to which clients are able to say to us, “I appreciate what 
you have been to me, and because of your faith in me, and what you have taught me, 
I am confident that I can go it alone.” Eventually, if we are effective, we will be out 
of business!
Declining to Give Advice
Quite  often  clients  who  are  suffering  come  to  a  therapy  session  seeking  and  even  
demanding advice. They want more than direction; they want a wise counselor to 
make a decision or resolve a problem for them. However, counseling should not be 
confused  with  dispensing  information.  Therapists  help  clients  discover  their  own  
solutions  and  recognize  their  own  freedom  to  act.  Even  if  we,  as  therapists,  were  
able to resolve clients’ struggles for them, we would be fostering their dependence 
on us. They would continually need to seek our counsel for every new twist in their 
difficulties.  Our  task  is  to  help  clients  make  independent  choices  and  accept  the  
consequences of their choices. The habitual practice of giving advice does not work 
toward this end.
Defining Your Role as a Counselor
One of your challenges as a counselor will be to define and clarify your professional 
role.  As  you  read  about  the  various  theoretical  orientations,  you  will  discover  the  
many different roles of counselors that are related to the various theories. As a coun-
selor, you will likely be expected to function with a diverse range of roles.

THE COunsElOR: PERsOn AnD PROfEssIOnAl          33 
From  my  perspective,  the  central  function  of  counseling  is  to  help  clients  rec-
ognize  their  own  strengths,  discover  what  is  preventing  them  from  using  their  
resources, and clarify what kind of life they want to live. Counseling is a process by 
which clients are invited to look honestly at their behavior and make certain deci-
sions  about  how  they  want  to  modify  the  quality  of  their  life.  In  this  framework  
counselors provide support and warmth, yet care enough to challenge clients so that 
they will be able to take the actions necessary to bring about significant change.
You will need to consider that the professional roles you assume are likely to be 
dependent  on  factors  such  as  the  client  populations  with  whom  you  are  working,  
the specific therapeutic services you are providing, the particular stage of counsel-
ing, and the setting in which you work. Your role will not be defined once and for all. 
You will have to reassess the nature of your professional commitments and redefine 
your role at various times.
Learning to Use Techniques Appropriately
When  you  are  at  an  impasse  with  a  client,  you  may  have  a  tendency  to  look  for  a  
technique to get the sessions moving. Ideally, therapeutic techniques should evolve 
from  the  therapeutic  relationship  and  the  material  presented,  and  they  should  
enhance the client’s awareness or suggest possibilities for experimenting with new 
behavior. It is imperative that you know the theoretical rationale for each technique 
you use, and you need to be aware that the techniques are appropriate for the goals 
of therapy. This does not mean that you need to restrict yourself to drawing on pro-
cedures within a single model; quite the contrary. However, it is important to avoid 
using techniques in a hit-or-miss fashion, to fill time, to meet your own needs, or to 
get things moving. Your methods need to be thoughtfully chosen as a way to help 
clients make therapeutic progress.
Developing Your Own Counseling Style
Be aware of any tendency to copy the style of a supervisor, therapist, or some other 
model. There is no one way to conduct therapy, and wide variations in approach can 
be  effective.  You  will  inhibit  your  potential  effectiveness  in  reaching  others  if  you  
attempt to imitate another therapist’s style or if you fit most of your behavior dur-
ing the session into the Procrustean bed of some expert’s theory. Your counseling 
style will be influenced by your teachers, therapists, and supervisors, but don’t blur 
your  potential  uniqueness  by  trying  to  imitate  them.  I  advocate  borrowing  from  
others, yet, at the same time, doing it in a way that is distinctive to you.
Maintaining Your Vitality as a Person and as a Professional
Ultimately, your single most important instrument is the person you are, and your 
most powerful technique is your ability to model aliveness and realness. It is of para-
mount importance that we take care of ourselves, for how can we take care of others 
if we are not taking care of ourselves? We need to work at dealing with those factors 
that threaten to drain life from us and render us helpless. I encourage you to con-
sider how you can apply the theories you will be studying to enhance your life from 
both a personal and a professional standpoint.

Learn to look within yourself to determine what choices you are making (and 
not making) to keep yourself vital. If you are aware of the factors that sap your vital-
ity as a person, you are in a better position to prevent the condition known as profes-
sional burnout. You have considerable control over whether you become burned out 
or not. You cannot always control stressful events, but you do have a great deal of 
control over how you interpret and react to these events. It is important to realize 
that  you  cannot  continue  to  give  and  give  while  getting  little  in  return.  There  is  a  
price to pay for always being available and for assuming responsibility over the lives 
and destinies of others. Become attuned to the subtle signs of burnout rather than 
waiting for a full-blown condition of emotional and physical exhaustion to set in. 
You would be wise to develop your own strategy for keeping yourself alive personally 
and professionally.
Self-monitoring is a crucial first step in self-care. If you make an honest inven-
tory of how well you are taking care of yourself in specific domains, you will have a 
framework for deciding what you may want to change. By making periodic assess-
ments  of  the  direction  of  your  own  life,  you  can  determine  whether  you  are  living  
the way you want to live. If not, decide what you are willing to actually do to make 
changes occur. By being in tune with yourself, by having the experience of centered-
ness and solidness, and by feeling a sense of personal power, you have the founda-
tion  for  integrating  your  life  experiences  with  your  professional  experiences.  Such  
an  awareness  can  provide  the  basis  for  retaining  your  physical  and  psychological  
vitality and for being an effective professional.
As counseling professionals, we tend to be caring people who are good at tak-
ing care of others, but often we do not treat ourselves with the same level of care. 
Self-care is not a luxury; it is an ethical mandate. If we neglect to care for ourselves, 
our clients will not be getting the best of us. If we are physically drained and psy-
chologically depleted, we will not have much to give to those with whom we work. 
It is not possible to provide nourishment to our clients if we are not nourishing 
ourselves.
Mental health professionals often comment that they do not have time to take 
care of themselves. My question to them is, “Can you afford not to take care of your-
self?” To successfully meet the demands of our professional work, we must take care 
of  ourselves  physically,  psychologically,  intellectually,  socially,  and  spiritually.  Ide-
ally,  our  self-care  should  mirror  the  care  we  provide  for  others.  If  we  hope  to  have  
the vitality and stamina required to stay focused on our professional goals, we need 
to incorporate a wellness perspective into our daily living. Wellness is the result of 
our  conscious  commitment  to  a  way  of  life  that  leads  to  zest,  peace,  vitality,  and  
happiness.
Wellness and self-care are being given increased attention in professional jour-
nals  and  at  professional  conferences.  When  reading  about  self-care  and  wellness,  
reflect on what you can do to put what you know into action. If you are interested in 
learning more about therapist self-care, I highly recommend Leaving It at the Office: A 
Guide to Psychotherapist Self-Care (Norcross & Guy, 2007) and Empathy Fatigue: Healing 
the Mind, Body, and Spirit of Professional Counselors (Stebnicki, 2008). For more on the 
topic of the counselor as a person and as a professional, see Creating Your Professional 
Path: Lessons From My Journey (Corey, 2010).

Summary
One of the basic issues in the counseling profession concerns the significance of the 
counselor  as  a  person  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.  In  your  professional  work,  
you are asking people to take an honest look at their lives and to make choices con-
cerning how they want to change, so it is critical that you do this in your own life. 
Ask yourself questions such as “What do I personally have to offer others who are 
struggling to find their way?” and “Am I doing in my own life what I may be urging 
others to do?”
You can acquire an extensive theoretical and practical knowledge and can make 
that  knowledge  available  to  your  clients.  But  to  every  therapeutic  session  you  also  
bring yourself as a person. If you are to promote change in your clients, you need to 
be open to change in your own life. This willingness to attempt to live in accordance 
with what you teach and thus to be a positive model for your clients is what makes 
you a “therapeutic person.”

Introduction
This chapter introduces some of the ethical principles and issues that will be 
a basic part of your professional practice. I hope to stimulate your thinking about 
the importance of ethical practice so you will have a sound foundation for making 
ethical  decisions.  Topics  addressed  include  balancing  clients’  needs  against  your  
own  needs,  ways  of  making  good  ethical  decisions,  educating  clients  about  their  
rights,  parameters  of  confidentiality,  ethical  concerns  in  counseling  diverse  client  
populations, ethical issues involving diagnosis, evidence-based practice, and dealing 
with multiple relationships and managing boundaries.
Students  sometimes  think  of  ethics  merely  as  a  list  of  rules  and  prohibitions  
that result in sanctions and malpractice actions if practitioners do not follow them. 
You will learn that being an ethical practitioners is far more complex than a set of 
rules. Mandatory ethics involves a level of ethical functioning at the minimum level 
of professional practice. In contrast, aspirational ethics focuses on doing what is in 
the best interests of clients. Functioning at the aspirational level involves the high-
est standards of thinking and conduct. Aspirational practice requires counselors to 
do more than simply meet the letter of the ethics code. It entails understanding the 
spirit of the code and the principles on which the code is based. Fear-based ethics does 
not  constitute  sound  ethical  practice.  Ethics  is  more  than  a  list  of  things  to  avoid  
for  fear  of  punishment.  Strive  to  work  toward  concern-based  ethics,  and  think  about  
how you can become the best practitioner possible (Corey, Corey, Corey, & Callanan, 
2015). Positive ethics is an approach taken by practitioners who want to do their 
best for clients rather than simply meet minimum standards to stay out of trouble 
(Knapp & VandeCreek, 2006).
 
Visit CengageBrain.com or watch the DVD for the video program on Chapter 3, Theory and 
Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the 
brief lecture for each chapter prior to reading the chapter.
Putting Clients’ Needs Before Your Own
As counselors we cannot always keep our personal needs completely separate from 
our relationships with clients. Ethically, it is essential that we become aware of our 
own  needs,  areas  of  unfinished  business,  potential  personal  problems,  and  espe-
cially our sources of countertransference. We need to realize how such factors could 
interfere with effectively and ethically serving our clients.
Our  professional  relationships  with  our  clients  exist  for  their  benefit.  A  use-
ful  question  to  frequently  ask  yourself  is  this:  “Whose  needs  are  being  met  in  this  
relationship, my client’s or my own?” It takes considerable professional maturity to 
make an honest appraisal of how your behavior affects your clients. It is not unethi-
cal for us to meet our personal needs through our professional work, but it is essen-
tial that these needs be kept in perspective. An ethical problem exists when we meet 
our needs, in either obvious or subtle ways, at the expense of our clients’ needs. It is 
crucial that we avoid exploiting or harming clients.
We all have certain blind spots and distortions of reality. As helping profession-
als, we must actively work toward expanding our self-awareness and learn to recognize

our areas of prejudice and vulnerability. If we are aware of our personal problems and 
are willing to work through them, there is less chance that we will project them onto 
clients. If certain problem areas surface and old conflicts become reactivated, we have 
an ethical obligation to do whatever it takes to avoid harming our clients.
We  must  also  examine  other,  less  obviously  harmful  personal  needs  that  can  
get in the way of creating growth-producing relationships, such as the need for con-
trol  and  power;  the  inordinate  need  to  be  nurturing;  the  need  to  change  others  in  
the direction of our own values; the need for feeling adequate, particularly when it 
becomes  overly  important  that  the  client  confirm  our  competence;  and  the  need  
to be respected and appreciated. It is crucial that we do not meet our needs at the 
expense of our clients. For an expanded discussion of this topic, see M. Corey and 
Corey (2016, chap. 1).
Ethical Decision Making
The  ready-made  answers  to  ethical  dilemmas  provided  by  professional  
 
organizations  typically  contain  only  broad  guidelines  for  responsible  practice.  In  
practice,  you  will  have  to  apply  the  ethics  codes  of  your  profession  to  the  many  
practical  problems  you  face.  Professionals  are  expected  to  exercise  prudent  judg-
ment when it comes to interpreting and applying ethical principles to specific situ-
ations. Although you are responsible for making ethical decisions, you do not have 
to do so alone. Learn about the resources available to you. Consult with colleagues, 
keep yourself informed about laws affecting your practice, keep up to date in your 
specialty field, stay abreast of developments in ethical practice, reflect on the impact 
your values have on your practice, and be willing to engage in honest self-examina-
tion.  You  should  also  be  aware  of  the  consequences  of  practicing  in  ways  that  are  
not sanctioned by organizations of which you are a member or the state in which 
you are licensed to practice.
The Role of Ethics Codes as a Catalyst for Improving Practice
Professional codes of ethics serve a number of purposes. They educate counseling 
practitioners  and  the  general  public  about  the  responsibilities  of  the  profession.  
They provide a basis for accountability, and protect clients from unethical practices. 
Perhaps most important, ethics codes provide a basis for reflecting on and improv-
ing your professional practice. Self-monitoring is a better route for professionals to 
take than being policed by an outside agency (Herlihy & Corey, 2015a).
From my perspective, an unfortunate recent trend is for ethics codes to increas-
ingly take on legalistic, rule-based dimensions. Being an ethical practitioner involves 
far more than following a list of rules. Practitioners anxious to avoid any litigation 
may gear their practices mainly toward fulfilling legal minimums. If we are too con-
cerned with being sued, it is unlikely that we will be very creative or effective in our 
work.  It  makes  sense  to  be  aware  of  the  legal  aspects  of  practice  and  to  know  and  
practice risk-management strategies, but we should not lose sight of what is best for 
our clients. One of the best ways to prevent being sued for malpractice is to demon-
strate respect for clients, keep client welfare as a central concern, and practice within 
the framework of professional codes.

40            CHAPTER THREE 
No code of ethics can delineate what would be the appropriate or best course of 
action in each problematic situation a professional will face. In my view, ethics codes 
are best used as guidelines to formulate sound reasoning and serve practitioners in 
making  the  best  judgments  possible.  A  number  of  professional  organizations  and  
their websites are listed near the end of the chapter; each has its own code of ethics, 
which you can access through its website. Compare your professional organization’s 
code of ethics to several others to understand their similarities and differences.
Some Steps in Making Ethical Decisions
Most models for ethical decision making focus on the application of principles to 
ethical  dilemmas.  My  colleagues  and  I  have  identified  a  series  of  procedural  steps  
to help you think through ethical problems when using these principles (see Corey, 
Corey, Corey, & Callanan, 2015):
Identify the problem or dilemma. Gather information that will shed 
light on the nature of the problem. This will help you decide whether 
the problem is mainly ethical, legal, professional, clinical, or moral.
Identify the potential issues. Evaluate the rights, responsibilities, and 
welfare of all those who are involved in the situation.
Look at the relevant ethics codes for general guidance on the matter. 
Consider whether your own values and ethics are consistent with or in 
conflict with the relevant guidelines.
Consider the applicable laws and regulations, and determine how they 
may have a bearing on an ethical dilemma.
Seek consultation from more than one source to obtain various per-
spectives on the dilemma, and document in the client’s record the 
suggestions you received from this consultation.
Brainstorm various possible courses of action. Continue discussing 
options with other professionals. Include the client in this process of 
considering options for action. Again, document the nature of this 
discussion with your client.
Enumerate the consequences of various decisions, and reflect on the 
implications of each course of action for your client.
Decide on what appears to be the best possible course of action. 
Once the course of action has been implemented, follow up to evalu-
ate the outcomes and to determine whether further action is neces-
sary. Document the reasons for the actions you took as well as your 
evaluation measures.
In reasoning through any ethical dilemma, there is rarely just one course of action 
to  follow,  and  practitioners  may  make  different  decisions.  The  more  subtle  the  
ethical dilemma, the more complex and demanding the decision-making process.
Professional maturity implies that you are open to questioning and discussing 
your quandaries with colleagues. In seeking consultation, it is generally possible to 
protect the identity of your client and still get useful input that is critical to making 
sound ethical decisions. Because ethics codes do not make decisions for you, it is a 
good practice to demonstrate a willingness to explore various aspects of a problem,

raise  questions,  discuss  ethical  concerns  with  others,  and  continually  clarify  your  
values and examine your motivations. To the degree that it is possible, include the 
client  in  all  phases  of  the  ethical  decision-making  process.  Again,  it  is  essential  to  
document  how  you  included  your  client  as  well  as  the  steps  you  took  to  ensure  
ethical practice.
The Right of Informed Consent
Regardless  of  your  theoretical  framework,  informed  consent  is  an  ethical  
and 
 
legal  requirement  that  is  an  integral  part  of  the  therapeutic  process.  It  also  
establishes  a  basic  foundation  for  creating  a  working  alliance  and  a  collabora-
tive  partnership  between  the  client  and  the  therapist.  informed  consent  involves  
the  right  of  clients  to  be  informed  about  their  therapy  and  to  make  autonomous  
decisions  pertaining  to  it.  Providing  clients  with  information  they  need  to  make  
informed choices tends to promote the active cooperation of clients in their coun-
seling plan. By educating your clients about their rights and responsibilities, you are 
both empowering them and building a trusting relationship with them. Seen in this 
light, informed consent is something far broader than simply making sure clients 
sign the appropriate forms. It is a positive approach that helps clients become active 
partners and true collaborators in their therapy.
Some aspects of the informed consent process include the general goals of coun-
seling, the responsibilities of the counselor toward the client, the responsibilities of 
clients, limitations of and exceptions to confidentiality, legal and ethical parameters 
that  could  define  the  relationship,  the  qualifications  and  background  of  the  prac-
titioner,  the  fees  involved,  the  services  the  client  can  expect,  and  the  approximate  
length of the therapeutic process. Further areas might include the benefits of coun-
seling, the risks involved, and the possibility that the client’s case will be discussed 
with the therapist’s colleagues or supervisors.
There are a host of ways to violate a client’s privacy through the inappropriate 
use of various forms of modern-day technology. Most of us have become accustomed 
to relying on technology, and we need to give careful thought to the subtle ways cli-
ent  privacy  can  be  compromised.  As  a  part  of  the  informed  consent  process,  it  is  
wise to discuss the potential privacy problems of using a wide range of technology 
and to take preventive measures to protect both you and your clients. For example, 
clients  and  counselors  should  carefully  consider  privacy  issues  before  agreeing  to  
send e-mail messages to clients’ workplace or home. A good policy is to limit e-mail 
exchanges to basic information such as appointment times.
Educating the client begins with the initial counseling session, and this process 
will continue for the duration of counseling. The challenge of fulfilling the spirit of 
informed consent is to strike a balance between giving clients too much information 
and giving them too little. For example, it is too late to tell minors that you intend 
to  consult  with  their  parents  after  they  have  disclosed  that  they  are  considering  an  
abortion. Young clients have a right to know about the limitations of confidentiality 
before they make such highly personal disclosures. Clients can be overwhelmed, how-
ever, if counselors go into too much detail initially about the interventions they are 
likely to make. It takes both intuition and skill for practitioners to strike a balance.

42            CHAPTER THREE 
Informed consent in counseling can be provided in written form, orally, or some 
combination of both. If it is done orally, therapists must make an entry in the client’s 
clinical record documenting the nature and extent of informed consent (Nagy, 2011). 
It is a good idea to provide basic information about the therapy process in writing, 
as  well  as  to  discuss  with  clients  topics  that  will  enable  them  to  get  the  maximum  
benefit from their counseling experience. Written information protects both clients 
and therapists and enables clients to think about the information and bring up ques-
tions at the following session. For a more complete discussion of informed consent 
and client rights, see Issues and Ethics in the Helping Professions (Corey, Corey, Corey, & 
Callanan, 2015, chap. 5), The Counselor and the Law: A Guide to Legal and Ethical Practice 
(Wheeler  &  Bertram,  2015,  chap.  2),  Ethical,  Legal,  and  Professional  Issues  in  Counseling 
(Remley & Herlihy, 2016), and Essential Ethics for Psychologists (Nagy, 2011, chap. 5).
Dimensions of Confidentiality
Confidentiality  and  privileged  communication  are  two  related  but  some-
what different concepts. Both of these concepts are rooted in a client’s right to pri-
vacy. 
confidentiality  is  an  ethical  concept,  and  in  most  states  it  is  the  legal  duty  of  
therapists not to disclose information about a client. Privileged communication 
is a legal concept that protects clients from having their confidential communications 
revealed in court without their permission (Herlihy & Corey, 2015a). All states have 
enacted  into  law  some  form  of  psychotherapist–client  privilege,  but  the  specifics  
of this privilege vary from state to state. These laws ensure that disclosures clients 
make in therapy will be protected from exposure by therapists in legal proceedings. 
Generally speaking, the legal concept of privileged communication does not apply 
to group counseling, couples counseling, family therapy, child and adolescent ther-
apy, or whenever there are more than two people in the room.
Confidentiality is central to developing a trusting and productive client–thera-
pist relationship. Because no genuine therapy can occur unless clients trust in the 
privacy of their revelations to their therapists, professionals have the responsibility 
to  define  the  degree  of  confidentiality  that  can  be  promised.  Counselors  have  an  
ethical and legal responsibility to discuss the nature and purpose of confidentiality 
with their clients early in the counseling process. In addition, clients have a right to 
know that their therapist may be discussing certain details of the relationship with 
a supervisor or a colleague.
Ethical Concerns with the Use of Technology
Issues  pertaining  to  confidentiality  and  privacy  can  become  more  com-
plicated  when  technology  is  involved.  Section  H  of  the  ACA  Code  of  Ethics  (2014)  
contains a new set of standards with regard to the use of technology, relationships 
established  through  computer-mediated  communication,  and  social  media  as  a  
delivery  platform.  Major  subsections  address  competency  to  provide  services  and  
the laws associated with distance counseling, components of informed consent and 
security (confidentiality and its limitations), client verification, the distance coun-
seling relationship (access, accessibility, and professional boundaries), maintenance 
of records, accessibility of websites, and the use of social media (Jencius, 2015).

Exceptions to Confidentiality and Privileged Communication
Although  most  counselors  agree  on  the  essential  value  of  confidentiality,  
 
they realize that other obligations may override this pledge. There are times when 
confidential information must be divulged, and there are many instances in which 
keeping  or  breaking  confidentiality  becomes  a  cloudy  issue.  In  determining  when  
to breach confidentiality, therapists must consider the requirements of the law, the 
institution in which they work, and the clientele they serve. Because these circum-
stances are frequently not clearly defined by accepted ethics codes, counselors must 
exercise professional judgment.
Whenever counselors are not clear about their obligations regarding confiden-
tiality or privileged communication, it is critical to seek consultation and to docu-
ment  these  discussions.  Remley  and  Herlihy  (2016)  identify  at  least  15  exceptions  
to  confidentiality  and  privileged  communication.  There  is  a  legal  requirement  to  
break  confidentiality  in  cases  involving  child  abuse,  abuse  of  the  elderly,  abuse  of  
dependent adults, and danger to self or others. All mental health practitioners and 
interns need to be aware of their duty to report in these situations and to know the 
limitations of confidentiality. Here are some other circumstances in which informa-
tion must legally be reported by counselors:
When the therapist believes a client under the age of 16 is the victim of 
incest, rape, child abuse, or some other crime
When the therapist determines that the client needs hospitalization
When information is made an issue in a court action
When clients request that their records be released to them or to a third 
party
In  general,  the  counselor’s  primary  obligation  is  to  protect  client  disclosures  as  a  
vital part of the therapeutic relationship. Informing clients about the limits of con-
fidentiality does not necessarily inhibit successful counseling.
For a more complete discussion of confidentiality, see Issues and Ethics in the Help-
ing  Professions  (Corey,  Corey,  Corey,  &  Callanan,  2015,  chap.  6),  Essential  Ethics  for  
Psychologists (Nagy, 2011, chap. 6), The Counselor and the Law: A Guide to Legal and Ethical 
Practice (Wheeler & Bertram, 2015, chap. 5), and Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in 
Counseling (Remley & Herlihy, 2016, chap. 5).
Ethical Issues From a Multicultural Perspective
Ethical  practice  requires  that  we  take  the  client’s  cultural  context  into  
account 
 
in  counseling  practice.  In  this  section  we  look  at  how  it  is  possible  for  
practitioners  to  practice  unethically  if  they  do  not  address  cultural  differences  in  
counseling practice.
Are Current Theories Adequate in Working With Culturally  
Diverse Populations?

tural  perspective.  Assumptions  made  about  mental  health,  optimum  human

development, the nature of psychopathology, and the nature of effective treatment 
may have little relevance for some clients. For traditional theories to be relevant in a 
multicultural  and  diverse  society,  they  must  incorporate  an  interactive  person-in-
the-environment focus. That is, individuals are best understood by taking into con-
sideration salient cultural and environmental variables. It is essential for therapists 
to  create  therapeutic  strategies  that  are  congruent  with  the  range  of  values  and  
behaviors that are characteristic of a pluralistic society.
Is Counseling Culture-Bound?
Historically, therapists have relied on Western therapeutic models to guide 
 
their practice and to conceptualize problems that clients present in mental health 
settings. Western models of counseling have some limitations when applied to spe-
cial  populations  and  cultural  groups  such  as  Asian  and  Pacific  Islanders,  Latinos,  
Native Americans, and African Americans. Multicultural writers have asserted that 
theories  of  counseling  and  psychotherapy  represent  different  worldviews,  each  
with its own values, biases, and assumptions about human behavior. Some of these 
approaches may not be applicable to clients from different racial, ethnic, and cul-
tural backgrounds. Methods often need to be modified when working with clients 
from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Contemporary therapy approaches are grounded on a core set of values, which 
are  neither  value-neutral  nor  applicable  to  all  cultures.  For  example,  the  values  of  
individual choice and autonomy are not universal. In some cultures the key values 
are  collectivist,  and  primary  consideration  is  given  to  what  is  good  for  the  group.  
Regardless  of  the  therapist’s  orientation,  it  is  crucial  to  listen  to  clients  and  deter-
mine why they are seeking help and how best to deliver the help that is appropriate 
for them. Competent therapists understand themselves as social and cultural beings 
and possess at least a minimum level of knowledge and skill that they can bring to 
bear on any counseling situation. These practitioners understand what their clients 
need and avoid forcing clients into a preconceived mold.
Cultural diversity is a fact of life in our world. To the extent that counselors are 
focused on the values of the dominant culture and insensitive to variations among 
groups and individuals, they are at risk for practicing unethically (Barnett & John-
son, 2015). Counselors need to understand and accept clients who have a different 
set of assumptions about life, and they need to be alert to the possibility of imposing 
their  own  worldview.  In  working  with  clients  from  different  cultural  backgrounds  
and life experiences, it is important that counselors resist making value judgments 
for them. It is essential to be mindful of diversity and social justice issues if we are to 
practice ethically and effectively (Chung & Bemak, 2012; Lee, 2015).
Focusing on Both Individual and Environmental Factors
A theoretical orientation provides practitioners with a map to guide them in a pro-
ductive  direction  with  their  clients.  It  is  hoped  that  the  theory  orients  them  but  
does  not  control  what  they  attend  to  in  the  therapeutic  venture.  Counselors  who  
operate from a multicultural framework also have certain assumptions and a focus 
that guides their practice. They view individuals in the context of the family and the

culture,  and  their  aim  is  to  facilitate  social  action  that  will  lead  to  change  within  
the client’s community rather than merely increasing the individual’s insight. Both 
multicultural practitioners and feminist therapists maintain that therapeutic prac-
tice will be effective only to the extent that interventions are tailored toward social 
action aimed at changing those factors that are creating the client’s problem rather 
than blaming the client for his or her condition (Chung & Bemak, 2012). These top-
ics are developed in more detail in later chapters.
An adequate theory of counseling does deal with the social and cultural factors 
of an individual’s problems. However, there is something to be said for helping cli-
ents deal with their response to environmental realities. Counselors may well be at a 
loss in trying to bring about social change when they are sitting with a client who is 
in pain because of social injustice. By using techniques from many of the traditional 
therapies,  counselors  can  help  clients  increase  their  awareness  of  their  options  in  
dealing  with  barriers  and  struggles.  However,  it  is  essential  to  focus  on  both  indi-
vidual and social factors if change is to occur, as the feminist, postmodern, and fam-
ily systems approaches to therapy teach us. Indeed, the person-in-the-environment 
perspective  acknowledges  this  interactive  reality.  For  a  more  detailed  treatment  of  
the ethical issues in multicultural counseling, see Chung and Bemak (2012), Corey, 
Corey, Corey, and Callanan (2015, chap. 4), and Lee (2013).
Ethical Issues in the Assessment Process
Both  clinical  and  ethical  issues  are  associated  with  the  use  of  assessment  
and 
 
diagnostic procedures. As you will see when you study the various theories of 
counseling, some approaches place heavy emphasis on the role of assessment as a 
prelude  to  the  treatment  process;  other  approaches  find  assessment  less  useful  in  
this regard.
The Role of Assessment and Diagnosis in Counseling
Assessment  and  diagnosis  are  integrally  related  to  the  practice  of  counseling  and  
psychotherapy, and both are often viewed as essential for planning treatment. For 
some approaches, a comprehensive assessment of the client is the initial step in the 
therapeutic  process.  The  rationale  is  that  specific  counseling  goals  cannot  be  for-
mulated  and  appropriate  treatment  strategies  cannot  be  designed  until  a  client’s  
past and present functioning is understood. Regardless of their theoretical orienta-
tion, therapists need to engage in assessment, which is generally an ongoing part of 
the therapeutic process. This assessment may be subject to revision as the clinician 
gathers further data during therapy sessions. Some practitioners consider assessment 
as a part of the process that leads to a formal diagnosis.
assessment consists of evaluating the relevant factors in a client’s life to iden-
tify themes for further exploration in the counseling process. Diagnosis, which is 
sometimes part of the assessment process, consists of identifying a specific mental 
disorder  based  on  a  pattern  of  symptoms.  Both  assessment  and  diagnosis  can  be  
understood as providing direction for the treatment process.
Diagnosis may include an explanation of the causes of the client’s difficulties, an 
account of how these problems developed over time, a classification of any disorders,

a specification of preferred treatment procedure, and an estimate of the chances for 
a successful resolution. The purpose of diagnosis in counseling and psychotherapy 
is to identify disruptions in a client’s present behavior and lifestyle. Once problem 
areas are clearly identified, the counselor and client are able to establish the goals of 
the therapy process, and then a treatment plan can be tailored to the unique needs 
of the client. A diagnosis provides a working hypothesis that guides the practitioner 
in  understanding  the  client.  The  therapy  sessions  provide  useful  clues  about  the  
nature of the client’s problems. Thus diagnosis begins with the intake interview and 
continues throughout the duration of therapy.
The  classic  book  for  guiding  practitioners  in  making  diagnostic  assessments  
is  the  fifth  edition  of  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s  (2013)  Diagnostic  and  
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (also known as the DSM-5). Clinicians who work 
in  community  mental  health  agencies,  private  practice,  and  other  human  service  
settings are generally expected to assess client problems within this framework. This 
manual advises practitioners that it represents only an initial step in a comprehen-
sive evaluation and that it is necessary to gain information about the person being 
evaluated beyond that required for a DSM-5 diagnosis.
Sme  clinicians  view  diagnosis  as  central  to  the  counseling  process,  but  others  
view it as unnecessary, as a detriment, or as discriminatory against ethnic minorities 
and  women.  As  you  will  see  when  you  study  the  therapeutic  models  in  this  book,  
some approaches do not use diagnosis as a precursor to treatment.
Considering Ethnic and Cultural Factors in Assessment and Diagnosis 
 
A danger of the diagnostic approach is the possible failure of counselors to consider 
ethnic and cultural factors in certain patterns of behavior. The DSM-5 emphasizes 
the  importance  of  being  aware  of  unintentional  bias  and  keeping  an  open  mind  
to  the  presence  of  distinctive  ethnic  and  cultural  patterns  that  could  influence  
the  diagnostic  process.  Unless  cultural  variables  are  considered,  some  clients  may  
be  subjected  to  erroneous  diagnoses.  Certain  behaviors  and  personality  styles  
may  be  labeled  neurotic  or  deviant  simply  because  they  are  not  characteristic  of  
the  dominant  culture.  Counselors  who  work  with  diverse  client  populations  may  
erroneously conclude that a client is repressed, inhibited, passive, and unmotivated, 
all of which are seen as undesirable by Western standards.
The DSM-5 is based on a medical model of mental illness that defines problems 
as residing with the individual rather than in society. It does not take into account 
the political, economic, social, and cultural factors in the lives of clients, which may 
play a significant role in the problems of clients. The DSM system tends to patholo-
gize clients, perpetuating the oppression of clients from diverse groups (Remley & 
Herlihy,  2016).  Barnett  and  Johnson  (2015)  suggest  that  practitioners  give  careful  
consideration  before  rendering  a  diagnosis  and  take  into  consideration  the  reali-
ties  of  discrimination,  oppression,  and  racism  in  society  and  in  the  mental  health  
disciplines.
Assessment and Diagnosis From Various Theoretical Perspectives The theory 
from  which  you  operate  influences  your  thinking  about  the  use  of  a  diagnostic  
framework in your therapeutic practice. Many practitioners who use the cognitive 
behavioral  approaches  and  the  medical  model  place  heavy  emphasis  on  the  role

of  assessment  as  a  prelude  to  the  treatment  process.  The  rationale  is  that  specific  
therapy  goals  cannot  be  designed  until  a  clear  picture  emerges  of  the  client’s  past  
and  present  functioning.  In  addition,  progress,  change,  improvement,  or  success  
may  be  difficult  to  evaluate  without  an  initial  assessment.  Counselors  who  base  
their  practice  on  the  relationship-oriented  approaches  tend  to  view  the  process  
of  assessment  and  diagnosis  as  external  to  the  immediacy  of  the  client–counselor  
relationship, impeding their understanding of the subjective world of the client. As 
you will see in Chapter 12, feminist therapists contend that traditional diagnostic 
practices are often oppressive and that such practices are based on a White, male-
centered,  Western  notion  of  mental  health  and  mental  illness.  Both  the  feminist  
perspective   and   the   postmodern   approaches   (Chapter   13)   charge   that   these   
diagnoses ignore societal contexts. Therapists with a feminist, social constructionist, 
solution-focused, or narrative therapy orientation challenge many DSM-5 diagnoses. 
However,  these  practitioners  do  make  assessments  and  draw  conclusions  about  
client  problems  and  strengths.  Regardless  of  the  particular  theory  espoused  by  a  
therapist, both clinical and ethical issues are associated with the use of assessment 
procedures and possibly a diagnosis as part of a treatment plan.
A  Commentary  on  Assessment  and  Diagnosis  Most  practitioners  and  many  
writers  in  the  field  consider  assessment  and  diagnosis  to  be  a  continuing  process  
that focuses on understanding the client. The collaborative perspective that involves 
the  client  as  an  active  participant  in  the  therapy  process  implies  that  both  the  
therapist and the client are engaged in a search-and-discovery process from the first 
session  to  the  last.  Even  though  some  practitioners  may  avoid  formal  diagnostic  
procedures and terminology, making tentative hypotheses and sharing them with 
clients throughout the process is a form of ongoing diagnosis. This perspective on 
assessment  and  diagnosis  is  consistent  with  the  principles  of  feminist  therapy,  an  
approach that is critical of traditional diagnostic procedures.
Ethical  dilemmas  may  be  created  when  diagnosis  is  done  strictly  for  insur-
ance  purposes,  which  often  entails  arbitrarily  assigning  a  client  to  a  diagnostic  
classification. However, it is a clinical, legal, and ethical obligation of therapists 
to screen clients for life-threatening problems such as organic disorders, schizo-
phrenia,  bipolar  disorder,  and  suicidal  types  of  depression.  Students  need  to  
learn the clinical skills necessary to do this type of screening, which is a form of 
diagnostic thinking.
It is essential to assess the whole person, which includes assessing dimensions 
of mind, body, and spirit. Therapists need to take into account the biological pro-
cesses  as  possible  underlying  factors  of  psychological  symptoms  and  work  closely  
with physicians. Clients’ values can be instrumental resources in the search for solu-
tions  to  their  problems,  and  spiritual  and  religious  values  often  illuminate  client  
concerns.

Ethical Aspects of Evidence-Based Practice
Mental  health  practitioners  are  faced  with  the  task  of  choosing  the  best  
 
interventions with a particular client. For many practitioners this choice is based on 
their theoretical orientation. In recent years, however, a shift has occurred toward 
promoting the use of specific interventions for specific problems or diagnoses based 
on  empirically  supported  treatments  (APA  Presidential  Task  Force  on  Evidence-
based  Practice,  2006;  Cukrowicz  et  al.,  2005;  Deegear  &  Lawson,  2003;  Edwards,  
Dattilio, & Bromley, 2004).
This  trend  toward  specific,  empirically  supported  treatment  is  referred  to  as  
evidence-based practice (
ebP): “the integration of the best available research with 
clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences” 
(APA  Presidential  Task  Force  on  Evidence-based  Practice,  2006,  p.  273).  Increas-
ingly,  those  practitioners  who  work  in  a  behavioral  health  care  system  must  cope  
with the challenges associated with evidence-based practice. Norcross, Hogan, and 
Koocher (2008) advocate for inclusive evidence-based practices that incorporate the 
three pillars of EBP: (1) looking for the best available research, (2) relying on clinical 
expertise, and (3) taking into consideration the client’s characteristics, culture, and 
preferences.
Many aspects of treatment—the therapy relationship, the therapist’s personality 
and therapeutic style, the client, and environmental factors—are vital contributors 
to  the  success  of  psychotherapy.  Evidence-based  practices  tend  to  emphasize  only  
one of these aspects—interventions based on the best available research. The central 
aim of evidence-based practice is to require psychotherapists to base their practice 
on techniques that have empirical evidence to support their efficacy. Research stud-
ies empirically analyze the most effective and efficient treatments, which then can be 
widely implemented in clinical practice (Norcross, Beutler, & Levant, 2006).
In  many  mental  health  settings,  clinicians  are  pressured  to  use  interventions  
that  are  both  brief  and  standardized.  In  such  settings,  treatments  are  operational-
ized  by  reliance  on  a  treatment  manual  that  identifies  what  is  to  be  done  in  each  
therapy session and how many sessions will be required (Edwards et al., 2004). Many 
practitioners believe this approach is mechanistic and does not take into full consid-
eration the relational dimensions of the psychotherapy process and individual vari-
ability. Indeed, relying exclusively on standardized treatments for specific problems 
may raise another set of ethical concerns because the reliability and validity of these 
empirically based techniques is questionable.
Human  change  is  complex  and  difficult  to  measure  beyond  such  a  simplis-
tic  level  that  the  change  may  be  meaningless.  Furthermore,  not  all  clients  come  to  
therapy  with  clearly  defined  psychological  disorders.  Many  clients  have  existential  
concerns that do not fit with any diagnostic category and do not lend themselves to 
clearly specified symptom-based outcomes. EBP may have something to offer mental 
health  professionals  who  work  with  individuals  with  specific  emotional,  cognitive,  
and behavioral disorders, but it does not have a great deal to offer practitioners work-
ing with individuals who want to pursue more meaning and fulfillment in their lives.
Norcross  and  his  colleagues  (2006)  contend  that  the  call  for  accountability  
in  mental  health  care  is  here  to  stay  and  that  all  mental  health  professionals  are  
challenged by the mandate to demonstrate the efficiency, efficacy, and safety of the

services they provide. They emphasize that the overarching goal of EBP is to enhance 
the effectiveness of client services and to improve public health and warn that men-
tal health professionals need to take a proactive stance to make sure this goal is kept 
in  focus.  They  realize  there  is  potential  for  misuse  and  abuse  by  third-party  pay-
ers who could selectively use research findings as cost-containment measures rather 
than ways of improving the quality of services delivered.

Managing Multiple Relationships in Counseling Practice
Dual  or  multiple  relationships,  either  sexual  or  nonsexual,  occur  when  
 
counselors assume two (or more) roles simultaneously or sequentially with a client. 
This may involve assuming more than one professional role or combining profes-
sional  and  nonprofessional  roles.  The  term  multiple  relationship  is  more  often  used  
than the term dual relationship because of the complexities involved in these relation-
ships, but both terms appear in various professional codes of ethics, and the ACA 
(2014)  uses  the  term  nonprofessional  relationships.  In  this  section  I  use  the  broader  
term  of  multiple  relationships  to  encompass  both  dual  relationships  and  nonprofes-
sional relationships.
When clinicians blend their professional relationship with another kind of rela-
tionship  with  a  client,  ethical  concerns  must  be  considered.  Many  forms  of  non-
professional  interactions  or  nonsexual  multiple  relationships  pose  a  challenge  to  
practitioners.  Some  examples  of  nonsexual  dual  or  multiple  relationships  are  com-
bining  the  roles  of  teacher  and  therapist  or  of  supervisor  and  therapist;  bartering  
for  goods  or  therapeutic  services;  borrowing  money  from  a  client;  providing  ther-
apy  to  a  friend,  an  employee,  or  a  relative;  engaging  in  a  social  relationship  with  a  
client;  accepting  an  expensive  gift  from  a  client;  or  going  into  a  business  venture  
with  a  client.  Some  multiple  relationships  are  clearly  exploitative  and  do  serious  
harm  both  to  the  client  and  to  the  professional.  For  example,  becoming  emotion-
ally or sexually involved with a current client is clearly unethical, unprofessional, and 
illegal. Sexual involvement with a former client is unwise, can be exploitative, and is 
generally considered unethical.
Because  nonsexual  multiple  relationships  are  necessarily  complex  and  multi-
dimensional,  there  are  few  simple  and  absolute  answers  to  resolve  them.  It  is  not  
always possible to play a single role in your work as a counselor, nor is it always desir-
able. You may have to deal with managing multiple roles, regardless of the setting in 
which you work or the client population you serve. It is a wise practice to give careful 
thought  to  the  complexities  of  multiple  roles  and  relationships  before  embroiling  
yourself in ethically questionable situations.
Ethical  reasoning  and  judgment  come  into  play  when  ethics  codes  are  applied  
to specific situations. The ACA Code of Ethics (ACA, 2014) makes it clear that counsel-
ing professionals must learn how to manage multiple roles and responsibilities in an 
ethical way. This entails dealing effectively with the power differential that is inherent 
in  counseling  relationships  and  training  relationships,  balancing  boundary  issues,  
addressing nonprofessional relationships, and striving to avoid using power in ways 
that might cause harm to clients, students, or supervisees (Herlihy & Corey, 2015b).

Although multiple relationships do carry inherent risks, it is a mistake to con-
clude that these relationships are always unethical and necessarily lead to harm and 
exploitation.  Some  of  these  relationships  can  be  beneficial  to  clients  if  they  are  
implemented thoughtfully and with integrity (Zur, 2007). An excellent resource on 
the ethical and clinical dimensions of multiple relationships is Boundaries in Psycho-
therapy: Ethical and Clinical Explorations (Zur, 2007).
Perspectives on Multiple Relationships
What  makes  multiple  relationships  so  problematic?  Herlihy  and  Corey  
(2015b)  contend  that  some  of  the  problematic  aspects  of  engaging  in  multiple  
relationships are that they are pervasive; they can be difficult to recognize; they are 
unavoidable at times; they are potentially harmful, but not necessarily always harm-
ful; they can be beneficial; and they are the subject of conflicting advice from various 
experts.  A  review  of  the  literature  reveals  that  dual  and  multiple  relationships  are  
hotly debated. Except for sexual intimacy with current clients, which is unequivo-
cally unethical, there is not much consensus regarding the appropriate way to deal 
with multiple relationships.
Some  of  the  codes  of  the  professional  organizations  advise  against  forming  
multiple relationships, mainly because of the potential for misusing power, exploit-
ing the client, and impairing objectivity. When multiple relationships exploit clients, 
or have significant potential to harm clients, they are unethical. The ethics codes do 
not  mandate  avoidance  of  all  such  relationships,  however;  nor  do  the  codes  imply  
that  nonsexual  multiple  relationships  are  unethical.  The  current  focus  of  ethics  
codes  is  to  remain  alert  to  the  possibilities  of  harm  to  clients  and  to  develop  safe-
guard to protect clients. Although codes can provide some general guidelines, good 
judgment,  the  willingness  to  reflect  on  one’s  practices,  and  being  aware  of  one’s  
motivations are critical dimensions of an ethical practitioner. It bears repeating that 
multiple relationship issues cannot be resolved with ethics codes alone; counselors 
must  think  through  all  of  the  ethical  and  clinical  dimensions  involved  in  a  wide  
range of boundary concerns.
A  consensus  of  many  writers  is  that  multiple  relationships  are  inevitable  and  
unavoidable in some situations and that a global prohibition is not a realistic answer. 
Because interpersonal boundaries are not static but undergo redefinition over time, the 
challenge for practitioners is to learn how to manage boundary fluctuations and to deal 
effectively with overlapping roles (Herlihy & Corey, 2015b). One key to learning how to 
manage multiple relationships is to think of ways to minimize the risks involved.
Ways  of  Minimizing  Risk  In  determining  whether  to  proceed  with  a  multiple  
relationship, it is critical to consider whether the potential benefit to the client of 
such a relationship outweighs its potential harm. Some relationships may have more 
potential benefits to clients than potential risks. It is your responsibility to develop 
safeguards aimed at reducing the potential for negative consequences. Herlihy and 
Corey (2015b) identify the following guidelines:
Set healthy boundaries early in the therapeutic relationship. Informed 
consent is essential from the beginning and throughout the therapy 
process.

Involve clients in ongoing discussions and in the decision-making pro-
cess, and document your discussions. Discuss with your clients what 
you expect of them and what they can expect of you.
Consult with fellow professionals as a way to maintain objectivity and 
identify unanticipated difficulties. Realize that you don’t need to make 
a decision alone.
When multiple relationships are potentially problematic, or when 
the risk for harm is high, it is always wise to work under supervision. 
Document the nature of this supervision and any actions you take in 
your records.
Self-monitoring is critical throughout the process. Ask yourself whose 
needs are being met and examine your motivations for considering 
becoming involved in a dual or multiple relationship.
In working through a multiple relationship concern, it is best to begin by ascer-
taining  whether  such  a  relationship  can  be  avoided.  Nagy  (2011)  points  out  that  
multiple  relationships  cannot  always  be  avoided,  especially  in  small  towns.  Nor  
should every multiple relationship be considered unethical. However, when a thera-
pist’s objectivity and competence are compromised, the therapist may find that per-
sonal  needs  surface  and  diminish  the  quality  of  the  therapist’s  professional  work.  
Sometimes nonprofessional interactions are avoidable and your involvement would 
put the client needlessly at risk. In other cases multiple relationships are unavoid-
able. One way of dealing with any potential problems is to adopt a policy of com-
pletely  avoiding  any  kind  of  nonprofessional  interaction.  As  a  general  guideline,  
Nagy (2011) recommends avoiding multiple relationships to the extent this is pos-
sible. Therapists should document precautions taken to protect clients when such 
relationships are unavoidable. Another alternative is to deal with each dilemma as it 
develops, making full use of informed consent and at the same time seeking consul-
tation and supervision in dealing with the situation. This second alternative includes 
a professional requirement for self-monitoring. It is one of the hallmarks of profes-
sionalism  to  be  willing  to  grapple  with  these  ethical  complexities  of  day-to-day  
practice.
Establishing  Personal  and  Professional  Boundaries  Establishing  and  
 
maintaining consistent yet flexible boundaries is necessary if you are to effectively 
counsel  clients.  If  you  have  difficulty  establishing  and  maintaining  boundaries  in  
your personal life, you are likely to find that you will have difficulty when it comes 
to  managing  boundaries  in  your  professional  life.  Developing  appropriate  and  
effective  boundaries  in  your  counseling  practice  is  the  first  step  to  learning  how  
to  manage  multiple  relationships.  There  is  a  relationship  between  developing  
appropriate boundaries in the personal and professional realms. If you are successful 
in establishing boundaries in various aspects of your personal life, you have a good 
foundation for creating sound boundaries with clients.
One  important  aspect  of  maintaining  appropriate  professional  boundaries  is  
to  recognize  boundary  crossings  and  prevent  them  from  becoming  boundary  
violations. A boundary crossing is a departure from a commonly accepted practice 
that could potentially benefit a client. For example, attending the wedding of a client

may be extending a boundary, but it could be beneficial for the client. In contrast, a 
boundary violation is a serious breach that harms the client and is therefore uneth-
ical. A boundary violation is a boundary crossing that takes the practitioner out of 
the professional role, generally involves exploitation, and results in harm to a client 
(Gutheil & Brodsky, 2008). Flexible boundaries can be useful in the counseling pro-
cess when applied ethically. Some boundary crossings pose no ethical problems and 
may enhance the counseling relationship. Other boundary crossings may lead to a 
pattern of blurred professional roles and become problematic.
Social  Media  and  Boundaries  It  is  not  unusual  for  a  counselor  to  
receive a “friend request” from a client or former client. Facebook and other social 
media sites raise many ethical concerns for counselors regarding boundaries, dual 
relationships, confidentiality, and privacy. One possibility is to set up two distinct 
Facebook pages, one for professional use and the other for personal use. Spotts-De 
Lazzer (2012) believes practitioners will have to translate and maintain traditional 
ethics when it comes to social media and offers these recommendations:
Limit what is shared online.
Include clear and thorough social networking policies as part of the 
informed consent process.
Regularly update protective settings because social media providers 
often change their privacy rules.
As  social  media  use  continues  to  spread,  the  ACA  Code  of  Ethics  (2014)  emphasizes  
the need for counselors to develop a social media policy and to include that in their 
informed consent discussions. The virtual relationship between counselor and cli-
ent  and  how  counselors  can  safely  maintain  a  virtual  presence  are  emphasized  in  
ACA’s revised code (Jencius, 2015).
Becoming an Ethical Counselor
Knowing and following your profession’s code of ethics is part of being an 
 
ethical practitioner, but these codes do not make decisions for you. As you become 
involved in counseling, you will find that interpreting the ethical guidelines of your 
professional organization and applying them to particular situations demand the 
utmost  ethical  sensitivity.  Even  responsible  practitioners  differ  over  how  to  apply  
established  ethical  principles  to  specific  situations.  In  your  professional  work  you  
will  deal  with  questions  that  do  not  always  have  obvious  answers.  You  will  have  
to assume responsibility for deciding how to act in ways that will further the best 
interests of your clients.
Throughout your professional life you will need to reexamine the ethical ques-
tions raised in this chapter. You can benefit from both formal and informal oppor-
tunities  to  discuss  ethical  dilemmas  during  your  training  program.  Even  if  you  
resolve some ethical matters while completing a graduate program, there is no guar-
antee that these matters have been settled once and for all. These topics are bound to 
take on new dimensions as you gain more experience. Oftentimes students burden 
themselves unnecessarily with the expectation that they should resolve all potential

ethical problem areas before they begin to practice. Throughout your professional 
life, seek consultation from trusted colleagues and supervisors whenever you face an 
ethical  dilemma.  Ethical  decision  making  is  an  evolutionary  process  that  requires  
you  to  be  continually  open  and  self-reflective.  Becoming  an  ethical  practitioner  is  
not a final destination but a journey that will continue throughout your career.
Summary
It is essential that you learn a process for thinking about and dealing with ethical 
dilemmas,  keeping  in  mind  that  most  ethical  issues  are  complex  and  defy  simple  
solutions. A sign of good faith is your willingness to share your struggles with col-
leagues. Such consultation can be helpful in clarifying issues by giving you another 
perspective  on  a  situation.  New  issues  are  constantly  surfacing,  and  positive  eth-
ics  demands  periodic  reflection  and  an  openness  to  change  on  the  part  of  the  
practitioner.
If there is one fundamental question that can serve to tie together all the issues 
discussed in this chapter, it is this: “Who has the right to counsel another person?” 
This question can be the focal point of your reflection on ethical and professional 
issues. It also can be the basis of your self-examination each day that you meet with 
clients. Continue to ask yourself: “What makes me think I have a right to counsel 
others?” “What do I have to offer the people I’m counseling?” “Am I doing in my own 
life what I’m encouraging my clients to do?” At times you may feel that you have no 
ethical right to counsel others, perhaps because your own life isn’t always the model 
you would like it to be for your clients. More important than resolving all of life’s 
issues is knowing what kinds of questions to ask and remaining open to reflection.
This  chapter  has  introduced  you  to  a  number  of  ethical  issues  that  you  are  
bound  to  face  at  some  point  in  your  counseling  practice.  I  hope  your  interest  has  
been piqued and that you will want to learn more. For further reading on this impor-

The  Counselor  and  the  Law:  A  Guide  to  Legal  and  
Ethical  Practice  (Wheeler  &  Bertram,  2015)  offers  a  
comprehensive overview of the law as it pertains to 
counseling  practice.  It  highlights  ethical  and  legal  
responsibilities  of  counselors  and  identifies  risk-
management strategies.
Leaving It at the Office: A Guide to Psychotherapist Self-
Care  (Norcross  &  Guy,  2007)  addresses  12  self-care  
strategies that are supported by empirical evidence. 
The  authors  develop  the  position  that  self-care  is  
personally essential and professionally ethical. This 
is one of the most useful books on therapist self-care 
and on prevention of burnout.
Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Evidence-Based 
Responsiveness  (Norcross,  2011)  is  a  comprehensive  
treatment  of  the  effective  elements  of  the  therapy  
relationship.  Many  different  contributors  address  
ways of tailoring the therapy relationship to individ-
ual  clients.  Implications  from  research  for  effective  
clinical practice are presented.
Ethics Desk Reference for Counselors (Barnett & John-
son,  2015)  is  a  practical  guide  to  understand  and  
applying the ACA Code of Ethics. It is a reference that 
is easy to read, interesting, and has appeal for both 
students and practitioners.
ACA  Ethical  Standards  Casebook  (Herlihy  &  Corey,  
2015a)  contains  a  variety  of  useful  cases  that  are  
geared  to  the  ACA  Code  of  Ethics.  The  examples  
illustrate and clarify the meaning and intent of the 
standards.
Boundary   Issues   in   Counseling:   Multiple   Roles   and   
Responsibilities  (Herlihy  &  Corey,  2015b)  puts  the  
multiple  relationship  controversy  into  perspective.  
The book focuses on dual relationships in a variety

Introduction
Freud’s views continue to influence contemporary practice. Many of his basic con-
cepts  are  still  part  of  the  foundation  on  which  other  theorists  build  and  develop  
their ideas. Indeed, most of the theories of counseling and psychotherapy discussed 
in  this  book  have  been  influenced  by  psychoanalytic  principles  and  techniques.  
Some  of  these  therapeutic  approaches  extended  the  psychoanalytic  model,  others  
modified its concepts and procedures, and others emerged as a reaction against it.
Freud’s  psychoanalytic  system  is  a  model  of  personality  development  and  an  
approach to psychotherapy. He gave psychotherapy a new look and new horizons, 
calling attention to psychodynamic factors that motivate behavior, focusing on the 
role of the unconscious, and developing the first therapeutic procedures for under-
standing  and  modifying  the  structure  of  one’s  basic  character.  Freud’s  theory  is  a  
benchmark against which many other theories are measured.
I begin with discussion of the basic psychoanalytic concepts and practices that 
originated with Freud, then provide a glimpse of a few of the diverse approaches that 
SIGMUND    FREUD    (1856–1939)    was    
the   firstborn   in   a   Viennese   family   of   
three  boys  and  five  girls.  His  father,  like  
many  others  of  his  time  and  place,  was  
very  authoritarian.  Freud’s  family  back-
ground  is  a  factor  to  consider  in  under-
standing the development of his theory.
Even  though  Freud’s  family  had  lim-
ited  finances  and  was  forced  to  live  in  a  
crowded apartment, his parents made every 
effort   to   foster   his   obvious   intellectual   
capacities.  Freud  had  many  interests,  but  
his  career  choices  were  restricted  because  
of  his  Jewish  heritage.  He  finally  settled  on  medicine.  
Only  four  years  after  earning  his  medical  degree  from  
the University of Vienna at the age of 26, he attained a 
prestigious position there as a lecturer.
Freud  devoted  most  of  his  life  to  formulat-
ing  and  extending  his  theory  of  psychoanalysis.  
Interestingly,  the  most  creative  phase  of  his  life  
corresponded  to  a  period  when  he  was  experienc-
ing  severe  emotional  problems  of  his  own.  During  
his  early  40s,  Freud  had  numerous  psychosomatic  
disorders, as well as exaggerated fears of dying and 
other  phobias,  and  was  involved  in  the  difficult  
task  of  self-analysis.  By  exploring  the  meaning  of  
his own dreams, he gained insights into the dynam-
ics  of  personality  development.  He  first  examined  
his  childhood  memories  and  came  to  realize  the  
intense   hostility   he   had   felt   for   his   
father.  He  also  recalled  his  childhood  
sexual feelings for his mother, who was 
attractive,   loving,   and   protective.   He   
then clinically formulated his theory as 
he  observed  his  patients  work  through  
their own problems in analysis.
Freud  had  very  little  tolerance  for  
colleagues  who  diverged  from  his  psy-
choanalytic    doctrines.    He    attempted    
to  keep  control  over  the  movement  by  
expelling  those  who  dared  to  disagree.  
Carl  Jung  and  Alfred  Adler,  for  example,  
worked closely with Freud, but each founded his own 
therapeutic school after repeated disagreements with 
Freud on theoretical and clinical issues.
Freud  was  highly  creative  and  productive,  fre-
quently putting in 18-hour days. His collected works 
fill 24 volumes. Freud’s productivity remained at this 
prolific level until late in his life when he contracted 
cancer  of  the  jaw.  During  his  last  two  decades,  he  
underwent 33 operations and was in almost constant 
pain. He died in London in 1939.
As the originator of psychoanalysis, Freud distin-
guished himself as an intellectual giant. He pioneered 
new  techniques  for  understanding  human  behav-
ior,  and  his  efforts  resulted  in  the  most  comprehen-
sive  theory  of  personality  and  psychotherapy  ever  
developed.

fall  well  within  his  legacy.  We  are  in  an  era  of  theoretical  pluralism  in  psychoana-
lytic theory today and can no longer speak of the psychoanalytic theory of treatment 
(Wolitzky, 2011b). Both psychoanalysis and its more flexible variant, psychoanalyti-
cally oriented psychotherapy, are discussed in this chapter. In addition, I summarize 
Erik Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, which extends Freudian theory 
in several ways, and give brief attention to Carl Jung’s approach. Finally, we look at 
contemporary  psychoanalytic  approaches:  object-relations  theory,  self  psychology,  
and the relational model of psychoanalysis. These contemporary theories are varia-
tions on psychoanalytic theory that entail modification or abandonment of Freud’s 
drive theory but take Freud’s theories as their point of departure (Wolitzky, 2011b). 
Although  deviating  significantly  from  traditional  Freudian  psychoanalysis,  these  
approaches retain the emphasis on unconscious processes, the role of transference 
and  countertransference,  the  existence  of  ego  defenses  and  internal  conflicts,  and  
the importance of early life experiences (McWilliams, 2016).

Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
The Freudian view of human nature is basically deterministic. According to  
Freud,  our  behavior  is  determined  by  irrational  forces,  unconscious  motivations,  
and  biological  and  instinctual  drives  as  these  evolve  through  key  psychosexual  
stages in the first six years of life.
Instincts  are  central  to  the  Freudian  approach.  Although  he  originally  used  the  
term libido to refer to sexual energy, he later broadened it to include the energy of all 
the life instincts. These instincts serve the purpose of the survival of the individual 
and  the  human  race;  they  are  oriented  toward  growth,  development,  and  creativity.  
Libido, then, should be understood as a source of motivation that encompasses sexual 
energy but goes beyond it. Freud includes all pleasurable acts in his concept of the life 
instincts; he sees the goal of much of life as gaining pleasure and avoiding pain.
Freud  also  postulates  death  instincts,  which  account  for  the  aggressive  drive.  
At times, people manifest through their behavior an unconscious wish to die or to 
hurt themselves or others. Managing this aggressive drive is a major challenge to the 
human race. In Freud’s view, both sexual and aggressive drives are powerful determi-
nants of why people act as they do.
Structure of Personality
According  to  the  Freudian  psychoanalytic  view,  the  personality  consists  of  
three systems: the id, the ego, and the superego. These are names for psychological 
structures and should not be thought of as manikins that separately operate the per-
sonality; one’s personality functions as a whole rather than as three discrete segments. 
The id  is  roughly  all  the  untamed  drives  or  impulses  that  might  be  likened  to  the  
biological component. The ego attempts to organize and mediate between the id and

the reality of dangers posed by the id’s impulses. One way to protect ourselves from 
the  dangers  of  our  own  drives  is  to  establish  a  superego,  which  is  the  internalized  
social component, largely rooted in what the person imagines to be the expectations 
of parental figures. Because the point of taking in these imagined expectations is to 
protect  ourselves  from  our  own  impulses,  the  superego  may  be  more  punitive  and  
demanding than the person’s parents really were. Actions of the ego may or may not 
be conscious. For example, defenses typically are not conscious. Because ego and con-
sciousness are not the same, the slogan for psychoanalysis has shifted from “making 
the unconscious conscious” to “where there was id, let there be ego.”
From the orthodox Freudian perspective, humans are viewed as energy systems. 
The dynamics of personality consist of the ways in which psychic energy is distrib-
uted to the id, ego, and superego. Because the amount of energy is limited, one sys-
tem gains control over the available energy at the expense of the other two systems. 
Behavior is determined by this psychic energy.
The ID    The    id is the original system of personality; at birth a person is all id. The id is 
the primary source of psychic energy and the seat of the instincts. It lacks organization 
and  is  blind,  demanding,  and  insistent.  A  cauldron  of  seething  excitement,  the  id  
cannot  tolerate  tension,  and  it  functions  to  discharge  tension  immediately.  Ruled  
by  the  pleasure  principle,  which  is  aimed  at  reducing  tension,  avoiding  pain,  and  
gaining  pleasure,  the  id  is  illogical,  amoral,  and  driven  to  satisfy  instinctual  needs.  
The id never matures, remaining the spoiled brat of personality. It does not think but 
only wishes or acts. The id is largely unconscious, or out of awareness.
The Ego    The    ego has contact with the external world of reality. It is the “executive” 
that  governs,  controls,  and  regulates  the  personality.  As  a  “traffic  cop,”  it  mediates  
between   the   instincts   and   the   surrounding   environment.   The   ego   controls   
consciousness and exercises censorship. Ruled by the reality principle, the ego does 
realistic and logical thinking and formulates plans of action for satisfying needs. The 
ego, as the seat of intelligence and rationality, checks and controls the blind impulses 
of the id. Whereas the id knows only subjective reality, the ego distinguishes between 
mental images and things in the external world.
The  Superego    The    superego  is  the  judicial  branch  of  personality.  It  includes  a  
person’s moral code, the main concern being whether an action is good or bad, right 
or wrong. It represents the ideal rather than the real and strives not for pleasure but 
for perfection. The superego represents the traditional values and ideals of society 
as  they  are  handed  down  from  parents  to  children.  It  functions  to  inhibit  the  id  
impulses, to persuade the ego to substitute moralistic goals for realistic ones, and to 
strive for perfection. As the internalization of the standards of parents and society, 
the superego is related to psychological rewards and punishments. The rewards are 
feelings of pride and self-love; the punishments are feelings of guilt and inferiority.
Consciousness and the Unconscious
Perhaps Freud’s greatest contributions are his concepts of the unconscious and of 
the levels of consciousness, which are the keys to understanding behavior and the

problems of personality. The unconscious cannot be studied directly but is inferred 
from  behavior.  Clinical  evidence  for  postulating  the  unconscious  includes  the  
following:  (1)  dreams,  which  are  symbolic  representations  of  unconscious  needs,  
wishes,  and  conflicts;  (2)  slips  of  the  tongue  and  forgetting,  for  example,  a  famil-
iar  name;  (3)  posthypnotic  suggestions;  (4)  material  derived  from  free-association  
techniques;  (5)  material  derived  from  projective  techniques;  and  (6)  the  symbolic  
content of psychotic symptoms.
For Freud, consciousness is a thin slice of the total mind. Like the greater part of 
the iceberg that lies below the surface of the water, the larger part of the mind exists 
below the surface of awareness. The unconscious stores all experiences, memories, 
and  repressed  material.  Needs  and  motivations  that  are  inaccessible—that  is,  out  
of awareness—are also outside the sphere of conscious control. Most psychological 
functioning exists in the out-of-awareness realm. The aim of psychoanalytic therapy 
is to make the unconscious motives conscious, for only then can an individual exer-
cise  choice.  Understanding  the  role  of  the  unconscious  is  central  to  grasping  the  
essence of the psychoanalytic model of behavior.
Unconscious  processes  are  at  the  root  of  all  forms  of  neurotic  symptoms  and  
behaviors.  From  this  perspective,  a  “cure”  is  based  on  uncovering  the  meaning  of  
symptoms,  the  causes  of  behavior,  and  the  repressed  materials  that  interfere  with  
healthy functioning. It is to be noted, however, that intellectual insight alone does 
not resolve the symptom. The client’s need to cling to old patterns (repetition) must 
be  confronted  by  working  through  transference  distortions,  a  process  discussed  
later in this chapter.
Anxiety
Also essential to the psychoanalytic approach is its concept of anxiety. anxiety is a 
feeling  of  dread  that  results  from  repressed  feelings,  memories,  desires,  and  expe-
riences  that  emerge  to  the  surface  of  awareness.  It  can  be  considered  as  a  state  of  
tension that motivates us to do something. It develops out of a conflict among the 
id, ego, and superego over control of the available psychic energy. The function of 
anxiety is to warn of impending danger.
There  are  three  kinds  of  anxiety:  reality,  neurotic,  and  moral.  
reality  anxiety 
is  the  fear  of  danger  from  the  external  world,  and  the  level  of  such  anxiety  is  pro-
portionate to the degree of real threat. Neurotic and moral anxieties are evoked by 
threats  to  the  “balance  of  power”  within  the  person.  They  signal  to  the  ego  that  
unless appropriate measures are taken the danger may increase until the ego is over-
thrown. 
neurotic anxiety is the fear that the instincts will get out of hand and cause 
the  person  to  do  something  for  which  she  or  he  will  be  punished.  Moral  anxiety 
is  the  fear  of  one’s  own  conscience.  People  with  a  well-developed  conscience  tend  
to feel guilty when they do something contrary to their moral code. When the ego 
cannot  control  anxiety  by  rational  and  direct  methods,  it  relies  on  indirect  ones—
namely, ego-defense behavior.
Ego-Defense Mechanisms
ego-defense  mechanisms  help  the  individual  cope  with  anxiety  and  pre-
vent the ego from being overwhelmed. Rather than being pathological, ego defenses

are  normal  behaviors  that  can  have  adaptive  value  provided  they  do  not  become  
a  style  of  life  that  enables  the  individual  to  avoid  facing  reality.  The  defenses  
employed  depend  on  the  individual’s  level  of  development  and  degree  of  anxiety.  
Defense  mechanisms  have  two  characteristics  in  common:  (1)  they  either  deny  or  
distort reality, and (2) they operate on an unconscious level. Table 4.1 provides brief 
descriptions of some common ego defenses.
TabLE 4.1 Ego-Defense Mechanisms
DefenseUses for Behavior
RepressionThreatening or painful thoughts and 
feelings are excluded from awareness.
One of the most important Freudian processes, 
it is the basis of many other ego defenses and of 
neurotic disorders. Freud explained repression as an 
involuntary removal of something from consciousness. 
It is assumed that most of the painful events of the 
first five or six years of life are buried, yet these events 
do influence later behavior.
Denial“Closing one’s eyes” to the existence of 
a threatening aspect of reality.
Denial of reality is perhaps the simplest of all self-
defense mechanisms. It is a way of distorting what 
the individual thinks, feels, or perceives in a traumatic 
situation. This mechanism is similar to repression, yet 
it generally operates at preconscious and conscious 
levels.
Reaction formationActively expressing the opposite 
impulse when confronted with a 
threatening impulse.
By developing conscious attitudes and behaviors 
that are diametrically opposed to disturbing desires, 
people do not have to face the anxiety that would 
result if they were to recognize these dimensions 
of themselves. Individuals may conceal hate with a 
facade of love, be extremely nice when they harbor 
negative reactions, or mask cruelty with excessive 
kindness.
ProjectionAttributing to others one’s own 
unacceptable desires and impulses.
This is a mechanism of self-deception. Lustful, 
aggressive, or other impulses are seen as being 
possessed by “those people out there, but not by me.”
DisplacementDirecting energy toward another object 
or person when the original object or 
person is inaccessible.
Displacement is a way of coping with anxiety that 
involves discharging impulses by shifting from a 
threatening object to a “safer target.” For example, the 
meek man who feels intimidated by his boss comes 
home and unloads inappropriate hostility onto his 
children.
RationalizationManufacturing “good” reasons to 
explain away a bruised ego.
Rationalization helps justify specific behaviors, 
and it aids in softening the blow connected with 
disappointments. When people do not get positions 
they have applied for in their work, they think 
of logical reasons they did not succeed, and they 
sometimes attempt to convince themselves that they 
really did not want the position anyway.

SublimationDiverting sexual or aggressive energy 
into other channels.
Energy is usually diverted into socially acceptable and 
sometimes even admirable channels. For example, 
aggressive impulses can be channeled into athletic 
activities, so that the person finds a way of expressing 
aggressive feelings and, as an added bonus, is often 
praised.
RegressionGoing back to an earlier phase of 
development when there were fewer 
demands.
In the face of severe stress or extreme challenge, 
individuals may attempt to cope with their anxiety 
by clinging to immature and inappropriate behaviors. 
For example, children who are frightened in school 
may indulge in infantile behavior such as weeping, 
excessive dependence, thumb-sucking, hiding, or 
clinging to the teacher.
IntrojectionTaking in and “swallowing” the values 
and standards of others.
Positive forms of introjection include incorporation 
of parental values or the attributes and values of 
the therapist (assuming that these are not merely 
uncritically accepted). One negative example is that in 
concentration camps some of the prisoners dealt with 
overwhelming anxiety by accepting the values of the 
enemy through identification with the aggressor.
IdentificationIdentifying with successful causes, 
organizations, or people in the 
hope that you will be perceived as 
worthwhile.
Identification can enhance self-worth and protect 
one from a sense of being a failure. This is part of 
the developmental process by which children learn 
gender-role behaviors, but it can also be a defensive 
reaction when used by people who feel basically 
inferior.
CompensationMasking perceived weaknesses or 
developing certain positive traits to 
make up for limitations.
This mechanism can have direct adjustive value, and 
it can also be an attempt by the person to say “Don’t 
see the ways in which I am inferior, but see me in my 
accomplishments.”
Development of Personality
Importance  of  Early  Development  A  significant  contribution  of  the  
psychoanalytic model is delineation of the stages of psychosexual and psychosocial 
stages  of  development  from  birth  through  adulthood.  The  psychosexual  stages 
refer to the Freudian chronological phases of development, beginning in infancy.
Freud postulated three early stages of development that often bring people to 
counseling when not appropriately resolved. First is the oral stage, which deals with 
the inability to trust oneself and others, resulting in the fear of loving and forming 
close relationships and low self-esteem. Next, is the anal stage, which deals with the 
inability to recognize and express anger, leading to the denial of one’s own power as 
a person and the lack of a sense of autonomy. Third, is the phallic stage, which deals 
with the inability to fully accept one’s sexuality and sexual feelings, and also to dif-
ficulty in accepting oneself as a man or woman. According to the Freudian psycho-
analytic view, these three areas of personal and social development—love and trust,

dealing with negative feelings, and developing a positive acceptance of sexuality—are 
all grounded in the first six years of life. This period is the foundation on which later 
personality development is built. When a child’s needs are not adequately met dur-
ing these stages of development, an individual may become fixated at that stage and 
behave in psychologically immature ways later on in life.
Erikson’s Psychosocial Perspective The developmental stages postulated 
by Freud have been expanded by other theorists. Erik Erikson’s (1963) psychosocial 
perspective  on  personality  development  is  especially  significant.  Erikson  built  on  
Freud’s  ideas  and  extended  his  theory  by  stressing  the  psychosocial  aspects  of  
development  beyond  early  childhood.  The  psychosocial  stages  refer  to  Erikson’s  
basic psychological and social tasks, which individuals need to master at intervals 
from  infancy  through  old  age.  This  stage  perspective  provides  the  counselor  with  
the  conceptual  tools  for  understanding  key  developmental  tasks  characteristic  of  
the various stages of life. Erikson’s theory of development holds that psychosexual 
growth and psychosocial growth take place together, and that at each stage of life 
we face the task of establishing equilibrium between ourselves and our social world. 
He describes development in terms of the entire life span, divided by specific crises 
to be resolved. According to Erikson, a crisis is equivalent to a turning point in life 
when we have the potential to move forward or to regress. At these turning points, 
we  can  either  resolve  our  conflicts  or  fail  to  master  the  developmental  task.  To  a  
large extent, our life is the result of the choices we make at each of these stages.
Erikson is often credited with bringing an emphasis on social factors to contem-
porary psychoanalysis. 
classical psychoanalysis is grounded on id psychology, and 
it holds that instincts and intrapsychic conflicts are the basic factors shaping person-
ality  development  (both  normal  and  abnormal).  
contemporary  psychoanalysis 
tends  to  be  based  on  ego  psychology,  which  does  not  deny  the  role  of  intrapsychic  
conflicts but emphasizes the striving of the ego for mastery and competence through-
out the human life span. Ego psychology therapists assist clients in gaining awareness 
of  their  defenses  and  help  them  develop  better  ways  of  coping  with  these  defenses  
(McWilliams, 2016). Ego psychology deals with both the early and the later develop-
mental stages, for the assumption is that current problems cannot simply be reduced 
to  repetitions  of  unconscious  conflicts  from  early  childhood.  The  stages  of  adoles-
cence,  mid-adulthood,  and  later  adulthood  all  involve  particular  crises  that  must  be  
addressed.  As  one’s  past  has  meaning  in  terms  of  the  future,  there  is  continuity  in  
development, reflected by stages of growth; each stage is related to the other stages.
Viewing an individual’s development from a combined perspective that includes 
both psychosexual and psychosocial factors is useful. Erikson believed Freud did not 
go far enough in explaining the ego’s place in development and did not give enough 
attention  to  social  influences  throughout  the  life  span.  A  comparison  of  Freud’s  
psychosexual view and Erikson’s psychosocial view of the stages of development is 
presented in Table 4.2.
Counseling  Implications  By  taking  a  combined  psychosexual  and  psychosocial  
perspective,  counselors  have  a  helpful  conceptual  framework  for  understanding  
developmental issues as they appear in therapy. The key needs and developmental 
tasks, along with the challenges inherent at each stage of life, provide a model for

TabLE 4.2     Comparison of Freud’s Psychosexual Stages and Erikson’s  
Psychosocial Stages
Period of LifeFreudErikson
First year of lifeOral stage
Sucking at mother’s breasts satisfies need for food 
and pleasure. Infant needs to get basic nurturing, 
or later feelings of greediness and acquisitiveness 
may develop. Oral fixations result from deprivation 
of oral gratification in infancy. Later personality 
problems can include mistrust of others, rejecting 
others; love, and fear of or inability to form intimate 
relationships.
Infancy: Trust versus mistrust 
If significant others provide for basic physical 
and emotional needs, infant develops a 
sense of trust. If basic needs are not met, 
an attitude of mistrust toward the world, 
especially toward interpersonal relationships, 
is the result.
Ages 1-3Anal stage
Anal zone becomes of major significance in 
formation of personality. Main developmental 
tasks include learning independence, accepting 
personal power, and learning to express negative 
feelings such as rage and aggression. Parental 
discipline patterns and attitudes have significant 
consequences for child’s later personality 
development.
Early childhood: Autonomy versus shame and 
doubt
A time for developing autonomy. Basic 
struggle is between a sense of self-reliance and 
a sense of self-doubt. Child needs to explore 
and experiment, to make mistakes, and to 
test limits. If parents promote dependency, 
child’s autonomy is inhibited and capacity to 
deal with world successfully is hampered.
Ages 3-6Phallic stage
Basic conflict centers on unconscious incestuous 
desires that child develops for parent of opposite 
sex and that, because of their threatening nature, 
are repressed. Male phallic stage, known as Oedipus 
complex, involves mother as love object for boy. 
Female phallic stage, known as Electra complex, 
involves girl’s striving for father’s love and approval. 
How parents respond, verbally and nonverbally, to 
child’s emerging sexuality has an impact on sexual 
attitudes and feelings that child develops.
Preschool age: Initiative versus guilt 
Basic task is to achieve a sense of competence 
and initiative. If children are given freedom to 
select personally meaningful activities, they 
tend to develop a positive view of self and 
follow through with their projects. If they are 
not allowed to make their own decisions, they 
tend to develop guilt over taking initiative. 
They then refrain from taking an active stance 
and allow others to choose for them.
Ages 6-12Latency stage
After the torment of sexual impulses of preceding 
years, this period is relatively quiescent. Sexual 
interests are replaced by interests in school, 
playmates, sports, and a range of new activities. This 
is a time of socialization as child turns outward and 
forms relationships with others.
School age: Industry versus inferiority 
Child needs to expand understanding of 
world, continue to develop appropriate 
gender-role identity, and learn the basic skills 
required for school success. Basic task is to 
achieve a sense of industry, which refers to 
setting and attaining personal goals. Failure to 
do so results in a sense of inadequacy.
Ages 12-18Genital stage
Old themes of phallic stage are revived. This stage 
begins with puberty and lasts until senility sets 
in. Even though there are societal restrictions and 
taboos, adolescents can deal with sexual energy by 
investing it in various socially acceptable activities 
such as forming friendships, engaging in art or in 
sports, and preparing for a career.
Adolescence: Identity versus role confusion A 
time of transition between childhood and 
adulthood.
A time for testing limits, for breaking 
dependent ties, and for establishing a 
new identity. Major conflicts center on 
clarification of self-identity, life goals, and life’s 
meaning. Failure to achieve a sense of identity 
results in role confusion.

Ages 18-35Genital stage continues 
Core characteristic of mature adult is the freedom 
“to love and to work.” This move toward adulthood 
involves freedom from parental influence and 
capacity to care for others.
Young adulthood: Intimacy versus isolation.
Developmental task at this time is to form 
intimate relationships. Failure to achieve 
intimacy can lead to alienation and isolation.
Ages 35-60Genital stage continuesMiddle age: Generativity versus stagnation.
There is a need to go beyond self and 
family and be involved in helping the next 
generation. This is a time of adjusting to 
the discrepancy between one’s dream and 
one’s actual accomplishments. Failure to 
achieve a sense of productivity often leads to 
psychological stagnation.
Ages 60+Genital stage continuesLater life: Integrity versus despair 
If one looks back on life with few regrets and 
feels personally worthwhile, ego integrity 
results. Failure to achieve ego integrity can 
lead to feelings of despair, hopelessness, guilt, 
resentment, and self-rejection.
understanding some of the core conflicts clients explore in their therapy sessions. 
Questions such as these can give direction to the therapeutic process:
What are some major developmental tasks at each stage in life, and how 
are these tasks related to counseling?
What themes give continuity to this individual’s life?
What are some universal concerns of people at various points in life? How 
can people be challenged to make life-affirming choices at these points?
What is the relationship between an individual’s current problems and 
significant events from earlier years?
What choices were made at critical periods, and how did the person 
deal with these various crises?
What are the sociocultural factors influencing development that need 
to be understood if therapy is to be comprehensive?
Psychosocial theory gives special weight to childhood and adolescent factors that 
are  significant  in  later  stages  of  development  while  recognizing  that  the  later  
stages also have their significant crises. Themes and threads can be found running 
throughout clients’ lives.

(Wolitzky, 2011a). Two goals of Freudian psychoanalytic therapy are to make the 
unconscious  conscious  and  to  strengthen  the  ego  so  that  behavior  is  based  more  
on  reality  and  less  on  instinctual  cravings  or  irrational  guilt.  Successful  analysis  
is believed to result in significant modification of the individual’s personality and 
character structure. Therapeutic methods are used to bring out unconscious mate-
rial. Then childhood experiences are reconstructed, discussed, interpreted, and ana-
lyzed.  It  is  clear  that  the  process  is  not  limited  to  solving  problems  and  learning  
new behaviors. Rather, there is a deeper probing into the past to develop the level 
of  self-understanding  that  is  assumed  to  be  necessary  for  a  change  in  character.  
Psychoanalytic therapy is oriented toward achieving insight, but not just an intel-
lectual understanding; it is essential that the feelings and memories associated with 
this self-understanding be experienced.
Therapist’s Function and Role
In  classical  psychoanalysis,  analysts  typically  assume  an  anonymous  non-
judgmental stance, which is sometimes called the “blank-screen” approach. They 
avoid  self-disclosure  and  maintain  a  sense  of  neutrality  to  foster  a  transference 
relationship, in which their clients will make projections onto them. This transfer-
ence  relationship  is  a  cornerstone  of  psychoanalysis  and  “refers  to  the  transfer  of  
feelings originally experienced in an early relationship to other important people in 
a person’s present environment” (Luborsky, O’Reilly-Landry, & Arlow, 2011, p. 18). 
If therapists say little about themselves and rarely share their personal reactions, the 
assumption is that whatever the client feels toward them will largely be the product 
of feelings associated with other significant figures from the past. These projections, 
which  have  their  origins  in  unfinished  and  repressed  situations,  are  considered  
“grist for the mill,” and their analysis is the very essence of therapeutic work.
One  of  the  central  functions  of  analysis  is  to  help  clients  acquire  the  freedom  
to  love,  work,  and  play.  Other  functions  include  assisting  clients  in  achieving  self-
awareness, honesty, and more effective personal relationships; in dealing with anxi-
ety in a realistic way; and in gaining control over impulsive and irrational behavior. 
Establishing  a  therapeutic  alliance  is  a  primary  treatment  goal,  and  repairing  any  
damaged  alliance  is  essential  if  therapy  is  to  progress  (McWilliams,  2014).  The  
empathic  attunement  to  the  client  facilitates  the  analyst’s  appreciation  of  the  cli-
ent’s  intrapsychic  world  (Wolitzky,  2011b).  Particular  attention  is  given  to  the  cli-
ent’s resistances. The analyst listens in a respectful, open-minded way and decides 
when to make appropriate interpretations; tact and timing are essential for effective 
interpretations (McWilliams, 2014). A major function of interpretation is to acceler-
ate  the  process  of  uncovering  unconscious  material.  The  psychoanalytic  therapist  
pays  attention  to  both  what  is  spoken  and  what  is  unspoken,  listens  for  gaps  and  
inconsistencies in the client’s story, infers the meaning of reported dreams and free 
associations, and remains sensitive to clues concerning the client’s feelings toward 
the therapist.
Organizing  these  therapeutic  processes  within  the  context  of  understanding  
personality  structure  and  psychodynamics  enables  the  analyst  to  formulate  the  
nature  of  the  client’s  problems.  One  of  the  central  functions  of  the  analyst  is  to

teach  clients  the  meaning  of  these  processes  (through  interpretation)  so  that  they  
are able to achieve insight into their problems, increase their awareness of ways to 
change,  and  thus  gain  more  control  over  their  lives.  A  primary  aim  of  psychody-
namic approaches is to foster the capacity of clients to solve their own problems.
The process of psychoanalytic therapy is somewhat like putting the pieces of a 
puzzle together. Whether clients change depends considerably more on their readi-
ness to change than on the accuracy of the therapist’s interpretations. If the thera-
pist pushes the client too rapidly or offers ill-timed interpretations, therapy will not 
be  effective.  Change  occurs  through  the  process  of  reworking  old  patterns  so  that  
clients might become freer to act in new ways (Luborsky et al., 2011).
Client’s Experience in Therapy
Clients  interested  in  classical  psychoanalysis  must  be  willing  to  commit  
themselves to an intensive, long-term therapy process. After some face-to-face ses-
sions with the analyst, clients lie on a couch and engage in free association; that is, 
they try to say whatever comes to mind without self-censorship. This process of free 
association is known as the “fundamental rule.” Clients report their feelings, expe-
riences,  associations,  memories,  and  fantasies  to  the  analyst.  Lying  on  the  couch  
encourages deep, uncensored reflections and reduces the stimuli that might inter-
fere  with  getting  in  touch  with  internal  conflicts  and  productions.  It  also  reduces  
the  ability  of  clients  to  “read”  their  analyst’s  face  for  reactions,  which  fosters  the  
projections characteristic of a transference.
The client in psychoanalysis experiences a unique relationship with the analyst. 
The client is free to express any idea or feeling, no matter how irresponsible, scandal-
ous, politically incorrect, selfish, or infantile. The analyst remains nonjudgmental, 
listening carefully and asking questions and making interpretations as the analysis 
progresses. This structure encourages the client to loosen defense mechanisms and 
“regress,” experiencing a less rigid level of adjustment that allows for positive thera-
peutic growth but also involves some vulnerability. It is a responsibility of the analyst 
to keep the analytic situation safe for the client, so the analyst is not free to engage 
in spontaneous self-expression. Every intervention by the therapist is made to fur-
ther the client’s progress. In classical analysis, therapeutic neutrality and anonymity 
are valued by the analyst, and holding a consistent setting or “frame” plays a large 
part in this analytic technique. Therapeutic change requires an extended period of 
“working through” old patterns in the safety of the therapeutic relationship.
Psychodynamic therapy emerged as a way of shortening and simplifying the 
lengthy  process  of  classical  psychoanalysis  (Luborsky  et  al.,  2011).  Many  psycho-
analytically  oriented  practitioners,  or  psychodynamic  therapists  (as  distinct  from  
analysts), do not use all the techniques associated with classical analysis. However, 
psychodynamic  therapists  do  remain  alert  to  transference  manifestations,  explore  
the meaning of clients’ dreams, explore both the past and the present, offer interpre-
tations  for  defenses  and  resistance,  and  are  concerned  with  unconscious  material.  
Traditional analytic therapists make more frequent interpretations of transferences 
and  engage  in  fewer  supportive  interventions  than  do  psychodynamic  therapists  
(Wolitzky, 2011a).

Clients  in  psychoanalytic  therapy  make  a  commitment  with  the  therapist  to  
stick  with  the  procedures  of  an  intensive  therapeutic  process.  They  agree  to  talk  
because their verbal productions are the heart of psychoanalytic therapy. They are 
typically asked not to make any radical changes in their lifestyle during the period 
of  analysis,  such  as  getting  a  divorce  or  quitting  their  job.  The  reason  for  avoid-
ing  making  such  changes  pertains  to  the  therapeutic  process  that  oftentimes  is  
unsettling  and  also  associated  with  loosening  of  defenses.  These  restrictions  are  
less  relevant  to  psychoanalytic  psychotherapy  than  to  classical  psychoanalysis.  
Psychoanalytic  psychotherapy  typically  involves  fewer  sessions  per  week,  the  ses-
sions  are  usually  face  to  face,  and  the  therapist  is  supportive;  hence,  there  is  less  
therapeutic “regression.”
Psychoanalytic clients are ready to terminate their sessions when they and their 
analyst mutually agree that they have resolved those symptoms and core conflicts that 
were amenable to resolution, have clarified and accepted their remaining emotional 
problems, have understood the historical roots of their difficulties, have mastery of 
core  themes,  have  insight  into  how  their  environment  affects  them  and  how  they  
affect  the  environment,  have  achieved  reduced  defensiveness,  and  can  integrate  
their awareness of past problems with their present relationships. Wolitzky (2011a) 
lists other optimal criteria for termination, including the reduction of transference, 
accomplishing  the  main  goals  of  therapy,  an  acceptance  of  the  futility  of  certain  
strivings and childhood fantasies, an increased capacity for love and work, achieving 
more stable coping patterns, and a self-analytic capacity. Successful analysis answers 
a client’s “why” questions regarding his or her life. Curtis and Hirsch (2011) suggest 
that termination tends to bring up intense feelings of attachment, separation, and 
loss. Thus a termination date is set well enough in advance to talk about these feel-
ings and about what the client learned in psychotherapy. Therapists assist clients in 
clarifying what they have done to bring about changes.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
There are some differences between how the therapeutic relationship is con-
ceptualized by classical analysis and contemporary relational analysis. The classical 
analyst stands outside the relationship, comments on it, and offers insight-produc-
ing  interpretations.  In  contemporary  relational  psychoanalysis,  the  therapist  does  
not  strive  for  an  objective  stance.  Contemporary  psychodynamic  therapists  focus  
as much on here-and-now transference as on earlier reenactment. By bringing the 
past  into  the  present  relationship,  a  new  understanding  of  the  past  can  unfold  
(Wolitzky,  2011a).  Contemporary  psychodynamic  therapists  view  their  emotional  
communication with clients as a useful way to gain information and create connec-
tion. Analytic therapy focuses on feelings, perceptions, and action that are happen-
ing in the moment in the therapy sessions (Luborsky et al., 2011; McWilliams, 2014; 
Wolitzky, 2011a, 2011b). The therapeutic relationship is central to increasing client 
self-awareness,  self-understanding,  and  exploration  (Barber,  Muran,  McCarthy,  &  
Keefe,  2013).  Current  findings  of  interpersonal  neurobiology  lend  strong  support  
for  the  effectiveness  of  the  psychoanalytic  relationship  when  treating  clients  who  
have suffered interpersonal trauma and neglect (Schore, 2014).

Transference  and  countertransference  are  central  to  understanding  psychody-
namic  therapy.  A  significant  aspect  of  the  therapeutic  relationship  is  manifested  
through transference reactions. transference is the client’s unconscious shifting to 
the analyst of feelings, attitudes, and fantasies (both positive and negative) that are 
reactions to significant others in the client’s past. Transference involves the uncon-
scious  repetition  of  the  past  in  the  present.  “It  reflects  the  deep  patterning  of  old  
experiences in relationships as they emerge in current life” (Luborsky et al., 2011, p. 
47). A client often has a mixture of positive and negative feelings and reactions to 
a therapist. When these feelings become conscious and are transferred to the thera-
pist, clients can understand and resolve past “unfinished business.” As therapy pro-
gresses,  childhood  feelings  and  conflicts  begin  to  surface  from  the  depths  of  the  
unconscious, and clients regress emotionally. Transference takes place when clients 
resurrect  these  early  intense  conflicts  relating  to  love,  sexuality,  hostility,  anxiety,  
and resentment; bring them into the present; reexperience them; and attach them to 
the therapist. For example, clients may transfer unresolved feelings toward a stern 
and  unloving  father  to  the  therapist,  who,  in  their  eyes,  becomes  stern  and  unlov-
ing.  Angry  feelings  are  the  product  of  negative  transference,  but  clients  also  may  
develop a positive transference and, for example, fall in love with the therapist, wish 
to be adopted, or in many other ways seek the love, acceptance, and approval of an 
all-powerful therapist. In short, the therapist becomes a current substitute for sig-
nificant others.
If therapy is to produce change, the transference relationship must be worked 
through. The working-through process consists of repetitive and elaborate explo-
rations  of  unconscious  material  and  defenses,  most  of  which  originated  in  early  
childhood. Clients learn to accept their defensive structures and recognize how they 
may have served a purpose in the past (Rutan, Stone, & Shay, 2014). This results in a 
resolution of old patterns and enables clients to make new choices. Effective therapy 
requires that the client develop a relationship with the therapist in the present that 
is a corrective and integrative experience.
Clients have many opportunities to see the variety of ways in which their core 
conflicts and core defenses are manifested in their daily life. It is assumed that for 
clients  to  become  psychologically  independent  they  must  not  only  become  aware  
of this unconscious material but also achieve some level of freedom from behavior 
motivated by infantile strivings, such as the need for total love and acceptance from 
parental figures. If this demanding phase of the therapeutic relationship is not prop-
erly worked through, clients simply transfer their infantile wishes for universal love 
and  acceptance  to  other  figures.  It  is  precisely  in  the  client–therapist  relationship  
that the manifestation of these childhood motivations becomes apparent.
Regardless  of  the  length  of  psychoanalytic  therapy,  traces  of  our  childhood  
needs  and  traumas  will  never  be  completely  erased.  Infantile  conflicts  may  not  be  
fully resolved, even though many aspects of transference are worked through with 
a therapist. We may need to struggle at times throughout our life with feelings that 
we project onto others as well as with unrealistic demands that we expect others to 
fulfill.  In  this  sense  we  experience  transference  with  many  people,  and  our  past  is  
always a vital part of the person we are presently becoming.
It is a mistake to assume that all feelings clients have toward their therapists are 
manifestations of transference. Many of these reactions may have a reality base, and

clients’ feelings may well be directed to the here-and-now style the therapist exhibits. 
Not every positive response (such as liking the therapist) should be labeled “positive 
transference.”  Conversely,  a  client’s  anger  toward  the  therapist  may  be  a  function  
of the therapist’s behavior; it is a mistake to label all negative reactions as signs of 
“negative transference.”
The notion of never becoming completely free of past experiences has significant 
implications for therapists who become intimately involved in the unresolved con-
flicts of their clients. Even if the conflicts of therapists have surfaced to awareness, 
and  even  if  therapists  have  dealt  with  these  personal  issues  in  their  own  intensive  
therapy, they may still project distortions onto clients. Therapists’ countertransfer-
ence  reactions  are  inevitable  because  all  therapists  have  unresolved  conflicts  and  
personal vulnerabilities that are activated through their professional work. From a 
traditional psychoanalytic perspective, countertransference is viewed as a phenom-
enon that occurs when there is inappropriate affect, when therapists respond in irra-
tional ways, or when they lose their objectivity in a relationship because their own 
conflicts  are  triggered.  Countertransference  consists  of  a  therapist’s  unconscious  
emotional responses to a client based on the therapist’s own past, resulting in a dis-
torted perception of the client’s behavior (Rutan et al., 2014). Over the years this tra-
ditional view of countertransference has broadened to include all of the therapist’s 
reactions, not only to the client’s transference, but to all aspects of the client’s per-
sonality and behavior. In this broader perspective, countertransference involves the 
therapist’s total emotional response to a client and may include withdrawal, anger, 
love,  annoyance,  powerlessness,  avoidance,  overidentification,  control,  or  sadness.  
In today’s psychoanalytic practice, countertransference is manifested in the form of 
subtle nonverbal, tonal, and attitudinal actions that inevitably affect clients, either 
consciously or unconsciously (Curtis & Hirsch, 2011; Wolitzky, 2011b).
To  avoid  misunderstanding  and  overidentification  with  clients,  the  analytic  
approach   requires   therapists   to   undergo   their   own   analytic   psychotherapy.   
McWilliams  (2014)  emphasizes  how  important  it  is  for  therapists  to  access  and  
understand their unconscious and suggests that a key outcome of therapy is humility, 
which  provides  a  good  foundation  for  creating  authentic,  egalitarian,  and  healing  
connections  with  clients.  Personal  therapy  and  clinical  supervision  for  therapists  
can be helpful in better understanding how internal reactions influence the therapy 
process  and  how  to  use  these  countertransference  reactions  to  benefit  the  work  of  
therapy (Hayes, Gelso, & Hummel, 2011).
Not  all  countertransference  reactions  are  detrimental  to  therapeutic  progress.  
Indeed,  countertransference  reactions  are  often  the  strongest  source  of  data  for  
understanding the world of the client and for self-understanding on the therapist’s 
part.  For  example,  a  therapist  who  notes  a  countertransference  mood  of  irritabil-
ity  may  learn  something  about  a  client’s  pattern  of  being  demanding,  which  can  
be  explored  in  therapy.  Viewed  in  this  more  positive  way,  countertransference  can  
become a key avenue for helping the client gain self-understanding. Most research 
on countertransference has dealt with its deleterious effects, but Hayes (2004) sug-
gests it would be useful to undertake systematic study of the potential therapeutic 
benefits of countertransference.
Psychoanalytic  therapists  vary  in  the  manner  in  which  they  use  their  observa-
tions  of  countertransference.  In  some  instances  the  feelings  may  be  shared  with

the client, but traditional analytic therapists strive to minimize their expression of 
countertransference while silently learning from its inevitable occurrence. The abil-
ity of therapists to gain self-understanding and to establish appropriate boundaries 
with  clients  is  critical  in  managing  and  effectively  using  their  countertransference  
reactions (Hayes et al., 2011).
It  is  of  paramount  importance  that  therapists  develop  some  level  of  objectiv-
ity  and  not  react  defensively  and  subjectively  in  the  face  of  anger,  love,  adulation,  
criticism,  and  other  intense  feelings  expressed  by  their  clients.  If  psychotherapists  
become  aware  of  a  strong  aversion  to  certain  types  of  clients,  a  strong  attraction  
to  other  types  of  clients,  psychosomatic  reactions  that  occur  at  definite  times  in  
therapeutic relationships, and the like, it is imperative for them to seek professional 
consultation, clinical supervision, or enter their own therapy for a time to work out 
these personal issues that stand in the way of their being effective therapists.
Through  the  client–therapist  relationship,  clients  acquire  insights  into  the  
workings of their unconscious processes. Awareness of and insights into repressed 
material  are  the  bases  of  the  analytic  growth  process.  Clients  come  to  understand  
the association between their past experiences and their current behavior. The psy-
choanalytic approach assumes that without this dynamic self-understanding there 
can be no substantial personality change or resolution of present conflicts.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
This section deals with the techniques most commonly used by psychoana-
lytically  oriented  therapists.  It  also  includes  a  section  on  the  applications  of  the  
psychoanalytic  approach  to  group  counseling.  Psychoanalytic  or  psychodynamic  
therapy differs from traditional psychoanalysis in these ways:
The therapy has more to limited objectives than restructuring one’s 
personality.
The therapist is less likely to use the couch.
There are fewer sessions each week.
There is more frequent use of supportive interventions such as reassur-
ance, expressions of empathy and support, and suggestions.
There is more emphasis on the here-and-now relationship between 
therapist and client.
There is more latitude for therapist self-disclosure without “polluting 
the transference.”
Less emphasis is given to the therapist’s neutrality.
There is a focus on mutual transference and countertransference 
enactments.
The focus is more on pressing practical concerns than on working with 
fantasy material.
The  techniques  of  psychoanalytic  therapy  are  aimed  at  increasing  awareness,  
fostering  insights  into  the  client’s  behavior,  and  understanding  the  meanings  of  
symptoms. The therapy proceeds from the client’s talk to catharsis (or expression of 
emotion), to insight, to working through unconscious material. This work is done

to  attain  the  goals  of  intellectual  and  emotional  understanding  and  reeducation,  
which, it is hoped, will lead to personality change. The six basic techniques of psy-
choanalytic therapy are (1) maintaining the analytic framework, (2) free association, 
(3)  interpretation,  (4)  dream  analysis,  (5)  analysis  of  resistance,  and  (6)  analysis  of  
transference. See Case Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 2) 
for  an  illustration  by  Dr.  William  Blau,  a  psychoanalytically  oriented  therapist,  of  
some treatment techniques in the case of Ruth.
Maintaining the Analytic Framework
The  psychoanalytic  process  stresses  maintaining  a  particular  framework  aimed  
at  accomplishing  the  goals  of  this  type  of  therapy.  Maintaining  the  analytic  
framework refers to a whole range of procedural and stylistic factors, such as the 
analyst’s  relative  anonymity,  maintaining  neutrality  and  objectivity,  the  regularity  
and  consistency  of  meetings,  starting  and  ending  the  sessions  on  time,  clarity  on  
fees,  and  basic  boundary  issues  such  as  the  avoidance  of  advice  giving  or  imposi-
tion  of  the  therapist’s  values  (Curtis  &  Hirsch,  2011).  One  of  the  most  powerful  
features of psychoanalytically oriented therapy is that the consistent framework is 
itself a therapeutic factor, comparable on an emotional level to the regular feeding 
of an infant. Analysts attempt to minimize departures from this consistent pattern 
(such as vacations, changes in fees, or changes in the meeting environment). Where 
departures are unavoidable, these will often be the focus of interpretations.
Free Association
Free association is a central technique in psychoanalytic therapy, and it plays a key 
role  in  the  process  of  maintaining  the  analytic  framework.  In  free  association, 
clients  are  encouraged  to  say  whatever  comes  to  mind,  regardless  of  how  painful,  
silly,  trivial,  illogical,  or  irrelevant  it  may  seem.  In  essence,  clients  try  to  flow  with  
any feelings or thoughts by reporting them immediately without censorship. As the 
analytic work progresses, most clients will occasionally depart from this basic rule, 
and these resistances will be interpreted by the therapist when it is timely to do so.
Free association is one of the basic tools used to open the doors to unconscious 
wishes,  fantasies,  conflicts,  and  motivations.  This  technique  often  leads  to  some  
recollection of past experiences and, at times, a catharsis or release of intense feel-
ings  that  have  been  blocked.  This  release  is  not  seen  as  crucial  in  itself,  however.  
During the free-association process, the therapist’s task is to identify the repressed 
material that is locked in the unconscious. The sequence of associations guides the 
therapist in understanding the connections clients make among events. Blockings 
or disruptions in associations serve as cues to anxiety-arousing material. The thera-
pist  interprets  the  material  to  clients,  guiding  them  toward  increased  insight  into  
the underlying dynamics.
As analytic therapists listen to their clients’ free associations, they hear not only 
the surface content but also the hidden meaning. Nothing the client says is taken at 
face value. For example, a slip of the tongue can suggest that an expressed emotion 
is  accompanied  by  a  conflicting  affect.  Areas  that  clients  do  not  talk  about  are  as  
significant as the areas they do discuss.

Interpretation
interpretation  consists  of  the  analyst’s  pointing  out,  explaining,  and  even  teach-
ing the client the meanings of behavior that is manifested in dreams, free associa-
tion, resistances, defenses, and the therapeutic relationship itself. The functions of 
interpretations  are  to  enable  the  ego  to  assimilate  new  material  and  to  speed  up  
the process of uncovering further unconscious material. Interpretation is grounded 
in  the  therapist’s  assessment  of  the  client’s  personality  and  of  the  factors  in  the  
client’s  past  that  contributed  to  his  or  her  difficulties.  Under  contemporary  defi-
nitions,  interpretation  includes  identifying,  clarifying,  and  translating  the  client’s  
material.  Relational  psychoanalytic  therapists  present  possible  meanings  associ-
ated with a client’s thoughts, feelings, or events as a hypothesis rather than a truth 
about a client’s inner world (Curtis & Hirsch, 2011). Interpretations are provided in 
a collaborative manner to help clients make sense of their lives and to expand their 
consciousness.
The  therapist  uses  the  client’s  reactions  as  a  gauge  in  determining  a  client’s  
readiness to make an interpretation. It is important that interpretations be appro-
priately timed because the client will reject therapist interpretations that are poorly 
timed. A general rule is that interpretation should be presented when the phenom-
enon to be interpreted is close to conscious awareness. In other words, the therapist 
should interpret material that the client has not yet seen but is capable of tolerating 
and incorporating. Another general rule is that interpretation should start from the 
surface and go only as deep as the client is able to go.
Dream Analysis
Dream  analysis  is  an  important  procedure  for  uncovering  unconscious  material  
and giving the client insight into some areas of unresolved problems. During sleep, 
defenses are lowered and repressed feelings surface. Freud sees dreams as the “royal 
road  to  the  unconscious,”  for  in  them  one’s  unconscious  wishes,  needs,  and  fears  
are  expressed.  Some  motivations  are  so  unacceptable  to  the  person  that  they  are  
expressed in disguised or symbolic form rather than being revealed directly.
Dreams have two levels of content: latent content and manifest content. Latent 
content consists of hidden, symbolic, and unconscious motives, wishes, and fears. 
Because  they  are  so  painful  and  threatening,  the  unconscious  sexual  and  aggres-
sive impulses that make up latent content are transformed into the more acceptable 
manifest  content,  which  is  the  dream  as  it  appears  to  the  dreamer.  The  process  
by  which  the  latent  content  of  a  dream  is  transformed  into  the  less  threatening  
manifest content is called dream work. The therapist’s task is to uncover disguised 
meanings by studying the symbols in the manifest content of the dream.
During the session, therapists may ask clients to free associate to some aspect of 
the manifest content of a dream for the purpose of uncovering the latent meanings. 
Therapists  participate  in  the  process  by  exploring  clients’  associations  with  them.  
Interpreting  the  meanings  of  the  dream  elements  helps  clients  unlock  the  repres-
sion  that  has  kept  the  material  from  consciousness  and  relate  the  new  insight  to  
their  present  struggles.  Dreams  may  serve  as  a  pathway  to  repressed  material,  but  
dreams  also  provide  an  understanding  of  clients’  current  functioning.  Relational

psychoanalytic  therapists  are  particularly  interested  in  the  connection  of  dreams  
to clients’ lives. The dream is viewed as a significant message to clients to examine 
something that could be problematic if left unexamined (Curtis & Hirsch, 2011).
Analysis and Interpretation of Resistance
resistance,  a  concept  fundamental  to  the  practice  of  psychoanalysis,  is  anything  
that works against the progress of therapy and prevents the client from producing 
previously  unconscious  material.  Specifically,  resistance  is  the  client’s  reluctance  
to bring to the surface of awareness unconscious material that has been repressed. 
Resistance refers to any idea, attitude, feeling, or action (conscious or unconscious) 
that fosters the status quo and gets in the way of change. During free association 
or  association  to  dreams,  the  client  may  evidence  an  unwillingness  to  relate  cer-
tain thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Freud viewed resistance as an unconscious 
dynamic  that  people  use  to  defend  against  the  intolerable  anxiety  and  pain  that  
would arise if they were to become aware of their repressed impulses and feelings.
As  a  defense  against  anxiety,  resistance  operates  specifically  in  psychoanalytic  
therapy  to  prevent  clients  and  therapists  from  succeeding  in  their  joint  effort  to  
gain insights into the dynamics of the unconscious. An assumption of analytic treat-
ment is that clients wish both to change and to remain embedded in their old world. 
Clients tend to cling to their familiar patterns, regardless of how painful they may 
be.  Therapists  need  to  create  a  safe  climate  so  clients  can  recognize  resistance  and  
explore  it  in  therapy  (Curtis  &  Hirsch,  2011;  McWilliams,  2014;  Wolitzky,  2011a).  
Because  resistance  blocks  threatening  material  from  entering  awareness,  analytic  
therapists point it out, but Safran and Kriss (2014) caution therapists to avoid fram-
ing resistance in a way that implies that the client is not cooperating with the treat-
ment. Therapists’ interpretations help clients become aware of the reasons for the 
resistance  so  they  can  deal  with  them.  As  a  general  rule,  therapists  point  out  and  
interpret  the  most  obvious  resistances  to  lessen  the  possibility  of  clients’  rejecting  
the  interpretation  and  to  increase  the  chance  that  they  will  begin  to  look  at  their  
resistive behavior.
Resistances are not just something to be overcome. Because they are representa-
tive of usual defensive approaches in daily life, they need to be recognized as devices 
that defend against anxiety but that interfere with the ability to accept change that 
could lead to experiencing a more gratifying life. It is crucial that therapists respect 
the  resistances  of  clients  and  assist  them  in  working  therapeutically  with  their  
defenses. When handled properly, exploring resistance can be an extremely valuable 
tool in understanding the client.
Analysis and Interpretation of Transference
As  was  mentioned  earlier,  transference  manifests  itself  in  the  therapeutic  process  
when earlier relationships contribute to clients distorting the present with the ther-
apist. The transference situation is considered valuable because its manifestations 
provide clients with the opportunity to reexperience a variety of feelings that would 
otherwise  be  inaccessible.  Through  the  relationship  with  the  therapist,  clients  
express  feelings,  beliefs,  and  desires  that  they  have  buried  in  their  unconscious.

Interpreting  transference  is  a  route  to  elucidating  the  client’s  intrapsychic  life  
(Wolitzky, 2011b). Through this interpretation, clients can recognize how they are 
repeating the same dynamic patterns in their relationships with the therapist, with 
significant figures from the past, and in present relationships with significant oth-
ers.  Through  appropriate  interpretations  and  working  through  of  these  current  
expressions  of  early  feelings,  clients  are  able  to  become  aware  of  and  to  gradually  
change some of their long-standing patterns of behavior. Analytically oriented ther-
apists consider the process of exploring and interpreting transference feelings as the 
core of the therapeutic process because it is aimed at achieving increased awareness 
and personality change.
The  analysis  of  transference  is  a  central  technique  in  both  classical  psycho-
analysis  and  psychoanalytically  oriented  therapy,  for  it  allows  clients  to  achieve  
here-and-now  insight  into  the  influence  of  the  past  on  their  present  functioning.  
Interpretation of the transference relationship enables clients to work through old 
conflicts  that  are  keeping  them  fixated  and  retarding  their  emotional  growth.  In  
essence,  the  effects  of  early  relationships  are  counteracted  by  working  through  a  
similar  emotional  conflict  in  the  current  therapeutic  relationship.  An  example  of  
utilizing transference is given in a later section on the case of Stan.
Application to Group Counseling
The psychodynamic model offers a conceptual framework for understand-
ing the history of the members of a group and a way of thinking about how their 
past  is  affecting  them  now  in  the  group  and  in  their  everyday  lives.  Group  lead-
ers can think psychoanalytically, even if they do not use many psychoanalytic tech-
niques. Regardless of their theoretical orientation, it is well for group therapists to 
understand such psychoanalytic phenomena as transference, countertransference, 
resistance, and the use of ego-defense mechanisms as reactions to anxiety.
Transference  and  countertransference  have  significant  implications  for  the  
practice of group counseling and therapy. Group work may re-create early life situa-
tions that continue to affect the client. In most groups, individuals elicit a range of 
feelings  such  as  attraction,  anger,  competition,  and  avoidance.  These  transference  
feelings  may  resemble  those  that  members  experienced  toward  significant  people  
in their past. Members will most likely find symbolic mothers, fathers, siblings, and 
lovers in their group. Group participants frequently compete for the attention of the 
leader—a situation reminiscent of earlier times when they had to vie for their parents’ 
attention with their brothers and sisters. This rivalry can be explored in a group as a 
way of gaining increased awareness of how the participants dealt with competition 
as children and how their past success or lack of it affects their present interactions 
with others. A basic tenet of psychodynamic therapy groups is the notion that group 
participants, through their interactions within the group, re-create their social situ-
ation, implying that the group becomes a microcosm of their everyday lives (Rutan 
et al., 2014). Groups can provide a dynamic understanding of how people function 
in  out-of-group  situations.  Projections  onto  the  leader  and  onto  other  members  
are valuable clues to unresolved conflicts within the person that can be identified, 
explored, and worked through in the group.

The group therapist also has reactions to members and is affected by members’ 
reactions. Countertransference can be a useful tool for the group therapist to under-
stand the dynamics that might be operating in a group. However, group leaders need 
to be alert to signs of unresolved internal conflicts that could interfere with effec-
tive group functioning and create a situation in which members are used to satisfy 
the  leaders’  own  unfulfilled  needs.  If,  for  example,  a  group  leader  has  an  extreme  
need to be liked and approved of, the leader might behave in ways to get members’ 
approval and confirmation, resulting in behaviors primarily designed to please the 
group members and ensure their continued support.
Group  therapists  need  to  exercise  vigilance  lest  they  misuse  their  power  by  
turning the group into a forum for pushing clients to adjust by conforming to the 
dominant cultural values at the expense of losing their own worldview and cultural 
identity. Group practitioners also need to be aware of their own potential biases. The 
concept  of  countertransference  can  be  expanded  to  include  unacknowledged  bias  
and prejudices that may be conveyed unintentionally through the techniques used 
by group therapists.

counseling,  refer  to  Theory  and  Practice  of  Group  Counseling  (Corey,  2016,  chap.  6).  
Psychodynamic Group Psychotherapy (Rutan et al., 2014) also provides an excellent dis-
cussion of this subject.
Jung’s Perspective on the Development of Personality
At one time Freud referred to Carl Jung as his spiritual heir, but Jung even-
tually developed a theory of personality that was markedly different from Freudian 
psychoanalysis. Jung’s analytical psychology is an elaborate explanation of human 
nature  that  combines  ideas  from  history,  mythology,  anthropology,  and  religion  
(Schultz  &  Schultz,  2013).  Jung  made  monumental  contributions  to  our  deep  
understanding  of  the  human  personality  and  personal  development,  particularly  
during middle age.
Jung’s pioneering work places central importance on the psychological changes 
that are associated with midlife. He maintained that at midlife we need to let go of 
many of the values and behaviors that guided the first half of our life and confront 
our  unconscious.  We  can  best  do  this  by  paying  attention  to  the  messages  of  our  
dreams and by engaging in creative activities such as writing or painting. The task 
facing us during the midlife period is to be less influenced by rational thought and 
to instead give expression to these unconscious forces and integrate them into our 
conscious life (Schultz & Schultz, 2013).
Jung learned a great deal from his own midlife crisis. At age 81 he wrote about 
his recollections in his autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961), in which 
he also identified some of his major contributions. Jung made a choice to focus on 
the unconscious realm in his personal life, which influenced the development of his 
theory  of  personality.  However,  he  had  a  very  different  conception  of  the  uncon-
scious than did Freud. Jung was a colleague of Freud’s and valued many of his contri-
butions, but Jung eventually came to the point of not being able to support some of 
Freud’s basic concepts, especially his theory of sexuality. Jung (1961) recalled Freud’s

words to him: “My dear Jung, promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. This 
is the most essential thing of all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshak-
able bulwark” (p. 150). Jung became convinced that he could no longer collaborate 
with  Freud  because  he  believed  Freud  placed  his  own  authority  over  truth.  Freud  
had little tolerance for theoreticians such as Jung and Adler who dared to challenge 
his  theories.  Although  Jung  had  a  lot  to  lose  professionally  by  withdrawing  from  
Freud, he saw no other choice. He subsequently developed a spiritual approach that 
places great emphasis on being impelled to find meaning in life in contrast to being 
driven by the psychological and biological forces described by Freud.
Jung maintained that we are not merely shaped by past events (Freudian deter-
minism),  but  that  we  are  influenced  by  our  future  as  well  as  our  past.  Part  of  the  
nature of humans is to be constantly developing, growing, and moving toward a bal-
anced and complete level of development. For Jung, our present personality is shaped 
both by who and what we have been and also by what we aspire to be in the future. 
His  theory  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  humans  tend  to  move  toward  the  ful-
fillment or realization of all of their capabilities. Achieving individuation—the har-
monious integration of the conscious and unconscious aspects of personality—is an 
innate and primary goal. For Jung, we have both constructive and destructive forces, 
and to become integrated, it is essential to accept our dark side, or shadow, with its 
primitive impulses such as selfishness and greed. Acceptance of our shadow does not 
imply being dominated by this dimension of our being, but simply recognizing that 
this is a part of our nature.
Jung taught that many dreams contain messages from the deepest layer of the 
unconscious,  which  he  described  as  the  source  of  creativity.  Jung  referred  to  the  
collective  unconscious  as  “the  deepest  and  least  accessible  level  of  the  psyche,”  
which contains the accumulation of inherited experiences of human and prehu-
man  species  (as  cited  in  Schultz  &  Schultz,  2013,  p.  95).  Jung  saw  a  connection  
between  each  person’s  personality  and  the  past,  not  only  childhood  events  but  
also  the  history  of  the  species.  This  means  that  some  dreams  may  deal  with  an  
individual’s relationship to a larger whole such as the family, universal humanity, 
or generations over time. The images of universal experiences contained in the col-
lective unconscious are called archetypes. Among the most important archetypes 
are the persona, the anima and animus, and the shadow. The persona is a mask, 
or public face, that we wear to protect ourselves. The animus and the anima rep-
resent both the biological and psychological aspects of masculinity and feminin-
ity, which are thought to coexist in both sexes. The shadow has the deepest roots 
and is the most dangerous and powerful of the archetypes. It represents our dark 
side, the thoughts, feelings, and actions that we tend to disown by projecting them 
outward.  In  a  dream  all  of  these  parts  can  be  considered  manifestations  of  who  
and what we are.
Jung  agreed  with  Freud  that  dreams  provide  a  pathway  into  the  unconscious,  
but  he  differed  from  Freud  on  their  functions.  Jung  wrote  that  dreams  have  two  
purposes. They are prospective; that is, they help people prepare themselves for the 
experiences  and  events  they  anticipate  in  the  near  future.  They  also  serve  a  com-
pensatory function, working to bring about a balance between opposites within the 
person.  They  compensate  for  the  overdevelopment  of  one  facet  of  the  individual’s  
personality (Schultz & Schultz, 2013).

Jung viewed dreams more as an attempt to express than as an attempt to repress 
and disguise. Dreams are a creative effort of the dreamer in struggling with contra-
diction, complexity, and confusion. The aim of the dream is resolution and integra-
tion. According to Jung, each part of the dream can be understood as some projected 
quality  of  the  dreamer.  His  method  of  interpretation  draws  on  a  series  of  dreams  
obtained from a person, during the course of which the meaning gradually unfolds.

Contemporary Trends: Object-Relations Theory,  
Self Psychology, and Relational Psychoanalysis
Psychoanalytic theory continues to evolve. Freud emphasized intrapsychic 
conflicts pertaining to the gratification of basic needs. Writers in the neo-Freudian 
school  moved  away  from  this  orthodox  position  and  contributed  to  the  growth  
and expansion of the psychoanalytic movement by incorporating the cultural and 
social influences on personality. 
ego psychology is part of classical psychoanalysis 
with the emphasis placed on the vocabulary of id, ego, and superego, and on Anna 
Freud’s  identification  of  defense  mechanisms.  She  spent  most  of  her  professional  
life  adapting  psychoanalysis  to  children  and  adolescents.  Erikson  expanded  this  
perspective by emphasizing psychosocial development throughout the life span.
Psychoanalytic  theory  has  evolved,  undergoing  a  number  of  reformulations  
over the years (McWilliams, 2016). Today psychoanalytic theory is comprised of a 
variety  of  schools,  including  the  classical  perspective,  ego  psychology,  object  rela-
tions  and  interpersonal  psychoanalysis,  self  psychology,  and  relational  psycho-
analysis.  Rutan,  Stone,  and  Shay  (2014)  note  some  commonalities  between  these  
psychoanalytic  perspectives:  “All  presuppose  a  supportive,  warm,  but  neutral  and  
fairly unobtrusive therapist who strives to create a safe, supportive, and therapeutic 
relationship” (p. 73).
Object-relations  theory  encompasses  the  work  of  a  number  of  rather  differ-
ent psychoanalytic theorists who are especially concerned with investigating attach-
ment  and  separation.  Their  emphasize  is  how  our  relationships  with  other  people  
are affected by the way we have internalized our experiences of others and set up rep-
resentations of others within ourselves. Object relations are interpersonal relation-
ships as these are represented intrapsychically, and as they influence our interactions 
with the people around us. The term object was used by Freud to refer to that which 
satisfies a need, or to the significant person or thing that is the object, or target, of 
one’s feelings or drives. It is used interchangeably with the term other to refer to an 
important person to whom the child, and later the adult, becomes attached. Rather 
than  being  individuals  with  separate  identities,  others  are  perceived  by  an  infant  
as objects for gratifying needs. Object-relations theories have diverged from ortho-
dox psychoanalysis. However, some theorists, most notably Otto Kernberg, attempt 
to  integrate  the  increasingly  varied  ideas  that  characterize  this  school  of  thought  
within a classical psychoanalytic framework (St. Clair, 2004).
Traditional psychoanalysis assumes that the analyst can discover and name the 
intrapersonal “truth” about individual clients. As psychoanalytic theory has evolved,

the approach has more fully considered the unconscious influence of other people. 
self  psychology,  which  grew  out  of  the  work  of  Heinz  Kohut  (1971),  emphasizes  
how we use interpersonal relationships (self objects) to develop our own sense of self. 
Kohut  emphasized  nonjudgmental  acceptance,  empathy,  and  authenticity.  Kohut  
and other self psychologists put empathy in the forefront of psychoanalytic healing 
and  choose  interventions  based  on  them  being  genuinely  empathically  attuned  to  
clients (McWilliams, 2016).
The relational model is based on the assumption that therapy is an interactive 
process between client and therapist. Whether called intersubjective, interpersonal, 
or  relational,  a  number  of  contemporary  psychoanalytic  approaches  are  based  on  
the  exploration  of  the  complex  conscious  and  unconscious  dynamics  at  play  with  
respect  to  both  therapist  and  client.  The  relational  movement  ushered  in  a  new  
emphasis  on  a  more  egalitarian  therapeutic  style  (McWilliams,  2016).  Relational  
analysts put value on not knowing and approach clients with genuine curiosity. Ther-
apists expect to participate in mutual enactments, or repetition of themes from the 
client’s life that evoke themes of their own.
From the time of Freud to the late 20th century, the power between analyst and 
patient was unequal. Contemporary relational theorists have challenged what they 
consider  to  be  the  authoritarian  nature  of  the  traditional  psychoanalytic  relation-
ship and replaced it with a more egalitarian model. The task of relational analysis is 
to explore each client’s life in a creative way, customized to the therapist and client 
working together in a particular culture at a particular moment in time.
Mitchell  (1988,  2000)  has  written  extensively  about  these  new  conceptualiza-
tions of the analytic relationship. He integrates developmental theory, attachment 
theory, systems theory, and interpersonal theory to demonstrate the profound ways 
in which we seek attachments with others, especially early caregivers. Interpersonal 
analysts believe that countertransference provides an important source of informa-
tion about the client’s character and dynamics. Mitchell adds to this object-relations 
position  a  cultural  dimension,  noting  that  the  caregiver’s  qualities  reflect  the  par-
ticular  culture  in  which  the  person  lives.  We  are  all  deeply  embedded  within  our  
cultures.  Different  cultures  maintain  different  values,  so  there  can  be  no  objective  
psychic truths. Our internal (unconscious) structures are all relational and relative. 
This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  Freudian  notion  of  universal  biological  drives  that  
could be said to function in every human.
Summary of Stages of Development
Most  contemporary  psychoanalytic  theories  center  on  predictable  developmental  
sequences in which the early experiences of the self shift in relation to an expand-
ing awareness of others. Once self–other patterns are established, it is assumed they 
influence  later  interpersonal  relationships.  Specifically,  people  search  for  relation-
ships that match the patterns established by their earlier experiences. People who are 
either overly dependent or overly detached, for example, can be repeating patterns 
of  relating  they  established  with  their  mother  when  they  were  toddlers  (Hedges,  
1983).  These  newer  theories  provide  insight  into  how  an  individual’s  inner  world  
can  cause  difficulties  in  living  in  the  everyday  world  of  people  and  relationships  
(St. Clair, 2004).

Margaret  Mahler  (1968)  had  a  central  influence  on  contemporary  object-
relations  theory.  A  pediatrician  who  emphasized  the  observation  of  children,  she  
viewed the resolution of the Oedipus complex during Freud’s proposed phallic stage 
as less critical than the child’s progression from a symbiotic relationship with a mater-
nal figure toward separation and individuation. Her studies focus on the interactions 
between the child and the mother in the first thee years of life. Mahler conceptual-
izes the development of the self somewhat differently from the traditional Freudian 
psychosexual stages. Her belief is that the individual begins in a state of psychologi-
cal fusion with the mother and progresses gradually to separation. The unfinished 
crises and residues of the earlier state of fusion, as well as the process of separating 
and individuating, have a profound influence on later relationships. Object relations 
of later life build on the child’s search for a reconnection with the mother (St. Clair, 
2004). Psychological development can be thought of as the evolution of the way in 
which individuals separate and differentiate themselves from others.
Mahler calls the first three or four weeks of life normal infantile autism. Here the 
infant is presumed to be responding more to states of physiological tension than to 
psychological  processes.  Mahler  believes  the  infant  is  unable  to  differentiate  itself  
from  its  mother  in  many  respects  at  this  age.  According  to  Melanie  Klein  (1975),  
another  major  contributor  to  the  object-relations  perspective,  the  infant  perceives  
parts—breasts, face, hands, and mouth—rather than a unified self. In this undiffer-
entiated  state  there  is  no  whole  self,  and  there  are  no  whole  objects.  When  adults  
show  the  most  extreme  lack  of  psychological  organization  and  sense  of  self,  they  
may be thought of as returning to this most primitive infantile stage. Subsequent 
infant research by Daniel Stern (1985) has challenged this aspect of Mahler’s theory, 
maintaining that infants are interested in others practically from birth.
Mahler’s  next  phase,  called  symbiosis,  is  recognizable  by  the  3rd  month  and  
extends  roughly  through  the  8th  month.  At  this  age  the  infant  has  a  pronounced  
dependency  on  the  mother.  She  (or  the  primary  caregiver)  is  clearly  a  partner  and  
not  just  an  interchangeable  part.  The  infant  seems  to  expect  a  very  high  degree  of  
emotional attunement with its mother.
The separation–individuation process begins in the 4th or 5th month. During this 
time the child moves away from symbiotic forms of relating. The child experiences 
separation from significant others yet still turns to them for a sense of confirmation 
and comfort. The child may demonstrate ambivalence, torn between enjoying sepa-
rate  states  of  independence  and  dependence.  The  toddler  who  proudly  steps  away  
from the parents and then runs back to be swept up in approving arms illustrates 
some of the main issues of this period (Hedges, 1983, p. 109). Others are looked to as 
approving mirrors for the child’s developing sense of self; optimally, these relation-
ships can provide a healthy self-esteem.
Children  who  do  not  experience  the  opportunity  to  differentiate,  and  those  
who  lack  the  opportunity  to  idealize  others  while  also  taking  pride  in  themselves,  
may  later  suffer  from  narcissistic  character  disorders  and  problems  of  self-esteem.  
The narcissistic personality is characterized by a grandiose and exaggerated sense 
of  self-importance  and  an  exploitive  attitude  toward  others,  which  serve  the  func-
tion of masking a frail self-concept. Such individuals seek attention and admiration 
from others. They unrealistically exaggerate their accomplishments, and they have a 
tendency toward extreme self-absorption. Kernberg (1975) characterizes narcissistic

people as focusing on themselves in their interactions with others, having a great need 
to be admired, possessing shallow affect, and being exploitive and, at times, parasitic 
in their relationships with others. Kohut (1971) characterizes such people as perceiv-
ing threats to their self-esteem and as having feelings of emptiness and deadness.
“Borderline” conditions are also rooted in the period of separation–individuation. 
People with a borderline personality disorder have moved into the separation pro-
cess but have been thwarted by parental rejection of their individuation. In other words, 
a crisis ensues when the child does develop beyond the stage of symbiosis, but the par-
ents are unable to tolerate this beginning individuation and withdraw emotional sup-
port. Borderline people are characterized by instability, irritability, self-destructive acts, 
impulsive anger, and extreme mood shifts. They typically experience extended periods 
of disillusionment, punctuated by occasional euphoria. Kernberg (1975) describes the 
syndrome as including a lack of clear identity, a lack of deep understanding of other 
people, poor impulse control, and the inability to tolerate anxiety.
Mahler’s  final  subphase  in  the  separation–individuation  process  involves  a  
move toward constancy of self and object. This development is typically pronounced 
by  the  36th  month  (Hedges,  1983).  By  now  others  are  more  fully  seen  as  separate  
from the self. Ideally, children can begin to relate without being overwhelmed with 
fears of losing their sense of individuality, and they may enter into the later psycho-
sexual and psychosocial stages with a firm foundation of selfhood. Borderline and 
narcissistic disorders seem to be rooted in traumas and developmental disturbances 
during the separation–individuation phase. However, the full manifestations of the 
personality and behavioral symptoms tend to develop in early adulthood.
This  chapter  permits  only  a  glimpse  of  the  newer  formulations  in  psychoana-
lytic theory. If you would like to pursue this emerging approach, good overviews can 
be found in Mitchell (1988, 2000), Mitchell and Black (1995), and Wolitzky (2011b).
Treating  borderline  and  Narcissistic  Disorders  Some  of  the  most  powerful  
tools  for  understanding  borderline  and  narcissistic  personality  disorders  have  
emerged from the psychoanalytic models. Among the most significant theorists in 
this area are Kernberg (1975, 1976, 1997; Kernberg, Yeomans, Clarkin, & Levy, 2008), 
Kohut  (1971,  1977,  1984),  and  Masterson  (1976).  A  great  deal  of  psychoanalytic  
writing   deals   with   the   nature   and   treatment   of   borderline   and   narcissistic   
personality disorders and sheds new light on the understanding of these disorders. 
Kohut  (1984)  maintains  that  people  are  their  healthiest  and  best  when  they  can  
feel  both  independence  and  attachment,  taking  joy  in  themselves  and  also  being  
able  to  idealize  others.  Mature  adults  feel  a  basic  security  grounded  in  a  sense  of  
freedom, self-sufficiency, and self-esteem; they are not compulsively dependent on 
others but also do not have to fear closeness. If you are interested in learning more 
about  treating  individuals  with  borderline  personality  disorders  from  an  object-
relations  perspective,  see  Psychotherapy  for  Borderline  Personality  (Clarkin,  Yeomans,  
& Kernberg,  2006).
Some Directions of Contemporary Psychodynamic Therapy
Strupp  (1992)  maintains  that  the  various  contemporary  modifications  of  psycho-
analysis  have  infused  psychodynamic  psychotherapy  with  renewed  vitality  and

vigor. Although long-term analytic therapy will remain a luxury for most people in 
our society, Strupp sees a growing trend toward short-term treatments for specific 
disorders,  limited  goals,  and  containment  of  costs.  Some  of  the  directions  in  psy-
chodynamic theory and practice that Strupp identifies are summarized here:
Increased attention is being given to disturbances during childhood 
and adolescence.
The emphasis on treatment has shifted to dealing therapeutically with 
chronic personality disorders, borderline conditions, and narcissistic 
personality disorders. There is also a movement toward devising specific 
treatments for specific disorders.
Increased attention is being paid to establishing a good therapeutic 
alliance early in therapy. A collaborative working relationship is now 
viewed as a key factor in a positive therapeutic outcome.
There is a renewed interest in the development of briefer forms of psy-
chodynamic therapy, largely due to societal pressures for accountability 
and cost-effectiveness.
Strupp’s  assessment  of  the  current  scene  and  his  predictions  for  the  future  have  
been quite accurate.
The  Trend  Toward  brief,  Time-Limited  Psychodynamic  Therapy  Many  psy-
choanalytically  oriented  therapists  are  adapting  their  work  to  a  time-limited  
framework while retaining their original focus on depth and the inner life. These 
therapists support the use of briefer therapy when this is indicated by the client’s 
needs rather than by arbitrary limits set by a managed care system. Although there 
are different approaches to brief psychodynamic therapy, Prochaska and Norcross 
(2014) believe they all share these common characteristics:
Work within the framework of time-limited therapy.
Target a specific interpersonal problem and goals during the initial 
session.
Assume a less neutral therapeutic stance than is true of traditional ana-
lytic approaches.
Establish a strong working alliance early in the therapy.
Use interpretation relatively early in the therapy relationship.
Messer  and  Warren  (2001)  describe  brief  psychodynamic  therapy  (
bPt)  as  
a  promising  approach.  This  adaptation  applies  the  principles  of  psychodynamic  
theory and therapy to treating selective disorders within a preestablished time limit 
of, generally, 10 to 25 sessions. BPT uses key psychodynamic concepts such as the 
enduring  impact  of  psychosexual,  psychosocial,  and  object-relational  stages  of  
development; the existence of unconscious processes and resistance; the usefulness 
of  interpretation;  the  importance  of  the  working  alliance;  and  reenactment  of  the  
client’s past emotional issues in relation to the therapist.
Most  forms  of  the  time-limited  dynamic  approach  call  upon  the  therapist  to  
assume  an  active  and  directive  role  in  quickly  formulating  a  therapeutic  focus,  
such  as  a  central  theme  or  problem  area  that  guides  the  work  (Levenson,  2010).  
Some  possible  goals  of  this  approach  might  include  conflict  resolution,  greater

access to feelings, increasing choice possibilities, improving interpersonal relation-
ships, and symptom remission. Levenson emphasizes that the aim of time-limited 
dynamic  therapy  is  not  to  bring  about  a  cure  but  to  foster  changes  in  behavior,  
thinking, and feeling. This is accomplished by using the client–therapist relation-
ship  as  a  way  to  understand  how  the  person  interacts  in  the  world.  It  is  assumed  
that clients interact with the therapist in the same dysfunctional ways they interact 
with significant others.
McWilliams (2014, 2016) acknowledges the pressures psychoanalytic practitio-
ners  face  in  creating  short-term  treatments  that  focus  on  unconscious  processes,  
especially  as  they  are  manifested  and  influenced  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.  
Brief  dynamic  therapy  tends  to  emphasize  a  client’s  strengths,  competencies,  and  
resources in dealing with real-life issues. Levenson (2010) notes that a major modi-
fication of the psychoanalytic technique is the emphasis on the here and now of the 
client’s life rather than exploring the there and then of childhood.
BPT is an opportunity to begin the process of change, which continues long after 
therapy is terminated. Short-term treatments are based on conceptual approaches 
similar to those of long-term therapy, but the techniques used are different. Rather 
than asking clients to free associate, practitioners ask questions, are more direct and 
confrontive, and deal quickly with transference issues (Sharf, 2016). Levenson (2010) 
acknowledges  that  the  interactive,  directive,  focused,  and  self-disclosing  strategies  
of brief psychodynamic therapy are not suited for all clients or all therapists. This 
approach is generally not suitable for individuals with severe characterological dis-
orders or for those with severe depression. BPT is more appropriate for people who 
are neurotic, motivated, and focused (Sharf, 2016).
By the end of brief therapy, clients tend to have acquired a richer range of inter-
actions with others, and they continue to have opportunities to practice functional 
behaviors in daily life. At some future time, clients may have a need for additional 
therapy sessions to address different concerns. Instead of thinking of time-limited 
dynamic psychotherapy as a definitive intervention, it is best to view this approach 
as offering multiple, brief therapy experiences over an individual’s life span.
If  you  want  to  learn  more  about  time-limited  dynamic  therapy,  I  recommend  
Brief Dynamic Therapy (Levenson, 2010).
Psychoanalytic Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Psychoanalytically oriented therapy can be made appropriate for culturally 
diverse populations if techniques are modified to fit the settings in which a therapist 
practices. All of us have a background of childhood experiences and have addressed 
developmental  crises  throughout  our  lives.  Erikson’s  psychosocial  approach,  with  
its emphasis on critical issues in stages of development, has particular application 
to clients from diverse cultures. Erikson has made significant contributions to how 
social and cultural factors affect people in many cultures over the life span (Sharf, 
2016).  Therapists  can  help  their  clients  review  environmental  situations  at  the  
various  critical  turning  points  in  their  lives  to  determine  how  certain  events  have  
affected them either positively or negatively.

Psychotherapists need to recognize and confront their own potential sources of 
bias and how countertransference could be conveyed unintentionally through their 
interventions. To the credit of the psychoanalytic approach, it stresses the value of 
intensive psychotherapy as part of the training of therapists. This helps therapists 
become  aware  of  their  own  sources  of  countertransference,  including  their  biases,  
prejudices, and racial or ethnic stereotypes.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Traditional psychoanalytic approaches are costly, and psychoanalytic therapy is gen-
erally perceived as being based on upper- and middle-class values. All clients do not 
share these values, and for many the cost of treatment is prohibitive. Another short-
coming pertains to the ambiguity inherent in most psychoanalytic approaches. This 
can  be  problematic  for  clients  from  cultures  who  expect  direction  from  a  profes-
sional.  For  example,  many  Asian  American  clients  may  prefer  a  more  structured,  
directive, problem-oriented approach to counseling and may not continue therapy 
if a nondirective or unstructured approach is employed. Furthermore, intrapsychic 
analysis may be in direct conflict with some clients’ social framework and environ-
mental perspective. Psychoanalytic therapy is generally more concerned with long-
term personality reconstruction than with short-term problems of living.
Many writers on social justice counseling emphasize how important it is to con-
sider possible external sources of clients’ problems, especially if clients have experi-
enced an oppressive environment. The psychoanalytic approach can be criticized for 
failing to adequately address the social, cultural, and political factors that result in 
an individual’s problems. If there is not a balance between the external and internal 
perspectives, clients may feel responsible for their condition. However, the nonjudg-
mental stance that is a cornerstone of the psychoanalytic tradition may ameliorate 
any tendency to blame the client.
There  are  likely  to  be  some  difficulties  in  applying  a  psychoanalytic  approach  
with  low-income  clients.  If  these  clients  seek  professional  help,  they  are  generally  
dealing  with  a  crisis  situation  and  want  to  finding  solutions  to  concrete  prob-
lems, or at least some direction in addressing survival needs pertaining to housing, 
employment, and child care. This does not imply that low-income clients are unable 
to  profit  from  analytic  therapy;  rather,  this  particular  orientation  could  be  more  
beneficial after more pressing issues and concerns have been resolved.

n each of the theory chapters, the case of Stan is used 
to demonstrate the practical applications of the the-
ory in question. Refer to the last section of Chapter 1, 
where Stan’s biography is given, to refresh your mem-
ory of his central concerns.
The   psychoanalytic   approach   focuses   on   the   
unconscious   psychodynamics   of   Stan’s   behavior.   
Considerable  attention  is  given  to  material  that  he  
has  repressed.  At  the  extreme,  Stan  demonstrated  
a  self-destructive  tendency,  which  is  a  way  of  inflict-
ing  punishment  on  himself.  Instead  of  directing  his  
hostility toward his parents and siblings, he turned it 
inward.  Stan’s  preoccupation  with  drinking  could  be  
hypothesized  as  evidence  of  an  oral  fixation.  Because  
he never received love and acceptance during his early 
childhood,  he  is  still  suffering  from  this  deprivation

and  continues  to  desperately  search  for  approval  and  
acceptance  from  others.  Stan’s  gender-role  identifica-
tion was fraught with difficulties. He learned the basis 
of female–male relationships through his early experi-
ences with his parents. What he saw was fighting, bick-
ering,  and  discounting.  His  father  was  the  weak  one  
who always lost, and his mother was the strong, domi-
neering force who could and did hurt men. Stan gen-
eralized  his  fear  of  his  mother  to  all  women.  It  could  
be  further  hypothesized  that  the  woman  he  married  
was  similar  to  his  mother,  both  of  whom  reinforced  
his feelings of impotence.
The opportunity to develop a transference relation-
ship and work through it is the core of the therapy pro-
cess.  Stan  will  eventually  relate  to  me,  as  his  therapist,  
as  he  did  to  his  father,  and  this  process  will  be  a  valu-
able means of gaining insight into the origin of Stan’s 
difficulties  in  relating  to  others.  The  analytic  process  
stresses  an  intensive  exploration  of  Stan’s  past.  Stan  
devotes much therapy time to reliving and exploring his 
early past. As he talks, he gains increased understanding 
of  the  dynamics  of  his  behavior.  He  begins  to  see  con-
nections between his present problems and early expe-
riences  in  his  childhood.  Stan  explores  memories  of  
relationships with his siblings and with his mother and 
father and also explores how he has generalized his view 
of women and men from his view of these family mem-
bers. It is expected that he will reexperience old feelings 
and uncover buried feelings related to traumatic events. 
From  another  perspective,  apart  from  whatever  con-
scious insight Stan may acquire, the goal is for him to 
have  a  more  integrated  self,  where  feelings  split  off  as  
foreign (the id) become more a part of what he is com-
fortable with (the ego). In Stan’s relationship with me, 
his  old  feelings  can  have  different  outcomes  from  his  
past  experiences  with  significant  others  and  can  result  
in deep personality growth.
I am likely to explore some of these questions with 
Stan: “What did you do when you felt unloved?” “As a 
child,  what  did  you  do  with  your  negative  feelings?”  
“As  a  child,  could  you  express  your  anger,  hurt,  and  
fears?”  “What  effects  did  your  relationship  with  your  
mother and father have on you?” “What did this teach 
you about women and about men?” Brought into the 
here and now of the transference relationship, I might 
ask,  “When  have  you  felt  anything  like  you  felt  with  
your parents?”
The  analytic  process  focuses  on  key  influences  
in  Stan’s  developmental  years,  sometimes  explicitly,  
sometimes  in  terms  of  how  those  earlier  events  are  
being relived in the present analytic relationship. As 
he comes to understand how he has been shaped by 
these  past  experiences,  Stan  is  increasingly  able  to  
exert  control  over  his  present  functioning.  Many  of  
Stan’s  fears  become  conscious,  and  then  his  energy  
does  not  have  to  remain  fixed  on  defending  himself  
from unconscious feelings. Instead, he can make new 
decisions about his current life. He can do this only if 
he works through the transference relationship, how-
ever, for the depth of his endeavors in therapy largely 
determine  the  depth  and  extent  of  his  personality  
changes.
If  I  am  operating  from  a  contemporary  object-
relations  psychoanalytic  orientation,  my  focus  may  
well be on Stan’s developmental sequences. Particular 
attention is paid to understanding his current behav-
ior in the world as largely a repetition of one of his ear-
lier developmental phases. Because of his dependency, 
it  is  useful  in  understanding  his  behavior  to  see  that  
he  is  now  repeating  patterns  that  he  formed  with  his  
mother during his infancy. Viewed from this perspec-
tive, Stan has not accomplished the task of separation 
and individuation. He is still “stuck” in the symbiotic 
phase on some levels. He is unable to obtain his confir-
mation of worth from himself, and he has not resolved 
the  dependence–independence  struggle.  Looking  at  
his  behavior  from  the  viewpoint  of  self  psychology  
can  shed  light  on  his  difficulties  in  forming  intimate  
relationships.
Follow-Up: You continue 
as stan’s therapist
With each of the 11 theoretical orientations, you will 
be  encouraged  to  try  your  hand  at  applying  the  prin-
ciples  and  techniques  you  have  just  studied  in  the  
chapter to working with Stan from that particular per-
spective. The information presented about Stan from 
each  of  these  theory  chapters  will  provide  you  with  
some ideas of how you might continue working with 
him  if  he  were  referred  to  you.  Do  your  best  to  stay  
within the general spirit of each theory by identifying 
specific concepts you would draw from and techniques 
that you might use in helping Stan explore the strug-
gles he identifies.

How much interest would you have in Stan’s early 
childhood? What are some ways you’d help him 
see patterns between his childhood issues and his 
current problems?
Consider the transference relationship that is 
likely to be established between you and Stan. 
How might you react to his making you into a sig-
nificant person in his life?
In working with Stan, what countertransference 
issues might arise for you?
What resistances and defenses might you predict 
in your work with Stan? From a psychoanalytic 
perspective, how would you interpret and work 
with this resistance?
Which of the various forms of psychoanalytic 
therapy—classical, relational, or object relations—
would you be most inclined to apply in working 
with Stan?

n  each  of  the  theory  chapters,  the  case  of  Gwen  is  
used  to  demonstrate  the  practical  applications  of  
that theoretical approach. Refer to the last section of 
Chapter 1, where Gwen’s background information and 
intake  session  are  presented,  to  refresh  your  memory  
of her central concerns.
Gwen  show’s  up  late  for  her  appointment  and  
states she is feeling frustrated with a work project she 
is behind on.
Gwen: I feel like I am on the edge of falling apart, like 
nothing is going right and everyone is looking at 
me like I’m a failure. I am just sad and unable to 
put the pieces together. I am behind on everything 
... and I am scared I will lose it all.
I listen to Gwen with the goal of allowing her to con-
nect  to  what  lies  beneath  the  surface  of  her  strong  
emotions.  As  a  psychoanalytic  therapist,  I  believe  the  
genesis  of  psychological  problems  are  rooted  in  the  
unconscious  mind.  Issues  brought  into  session  often  
stem from unresolved childhood conflicts and trauma. 
Childhood pain and suffering is not necessarily rooted 
in  an  extreme  or  horrific  event;  children  may  repress  
memories of any negative emotional event.
My initial goal is to help Gwen see how her early 
history  is  affecting  her  current  habits,  feelings,  and  
behaviors. Once Gwen is able to bring the unconscious 
material  to  a  conscious  level,  she  can  better  under-
stand  her  triggers  and  recurrent  emotional  conflicts.  
In making unconscious material conscious, Gwen can 
recognize the origins of her behavior, explore some of 
these patterns, work through early experiences, release 
dysfunctional  behaviors,  and  begin  relating  to  life  
from a position of greater clarity and strength.
Gwen  continues  discussing  her  frustrations  with  
work  and  begins  to  cry.  I  help  Gwen  achieve  a  more  
relaxed state so she can bypass the conscious mind and 
find  out  what  is  happening  at  an  unconscious  level.  
My  intervention  is  not  the  typical  free  association  of  
traditional  psychoanalysis  but  rather  guided  associa-
tion based on familiar emotions.
Therapist: Sit back and relax for a moment. Go back 
to one of the very first times in life when you felt 
this same or a similar feeling of frustration. Let 
yourself go back in time, back to when you were a 
little girl and you had the sense that nothing was 
going right and that things were falling apart.
[I prompt Gwen].
 You feel yourself getting younger and younger. When 
you are there, tell me how old you are, who is there 
with you, and describe the situation.

I  watch  as  Gwen’s  facial  expression  begins  to  change.  
After a few minutes she begins to speak.
Gwen: I am 5 years old, and I am sitting at the kitchen 
table crying. I have on a pink dress, and the front 
of my dress is dirty. My mother had told me to wait 
for her in the car. Instead of waiting in the car, I 
started playing in the backyard and got dirty. She 
hit my legs, and I just cried and cried. She yelled 
and told me that I always mess everything up. All I 
wanted to do was to play. I never got to play, I just 
wanted to kick the ball around and have some fun.
Gwen  continues  to  cry  as  she  tells  me  about  her-
self  as  a  little  girl.  I  ask  her  to  go  to  another  time  in  
her  childhood  when  she  had  that  same  feeling  of  
frustration.
Gwen:
 I am 12 years old, and I am upstairs in my 
parent’s room. My little sister had set the bed on 
fire, and my parents are blaming me because I was 
supposed to be watching her. I tell them that I was 
watching her. I keep telling them that it is not my 
fault, but they don’t listen to me. They put me on 
punishment for two months, and I overhear them 
say that I never do anything right.
Therapist: What did that little girl need in those 
situations?
Gwen: I needed understanding, and someone to 
tell me it was going to be OK. I needed love, even 
though I was not the perfect little girl.
I ask Gwen to reflect on what decision she made at that 
time as a little girl. Gwen pauses and then replies.
Gwen: I decided I had to be perfect in order to be 
loved.
I ask Gwen to reflect on how often this early decision 
affects  her  life  now.  She  sits  quietly  for  a  while  and  
then comments that she often feels like that little girl. 
Gwen  is  surprised  by  the  feelings  and  insights  that  
have surfaced.
Gwen: I had not thought about those early times in 
ages. I can’t believe those situations still bother me. 
I had not realized that.
In  that  moment  Gwen  recognizes  the  power  of  the  
unconscious and how bringing the unconscious mate-
rial  to  the  surface  can  serve  as  a  healing  force  in  her  
life. I tell Gwen that as an adult she is now able to give 
that little girl aspects of herself: love, acceptance, and 
attention.
Gwen tells me that loving the little girl aspects of 
her sounds a bit strange, but she is open to being gen-
tler with herself—just as she wanted her parents to be 
easier on her and love her as she was.
Gwen:
 I never imagined that those spankings and 
getting yelled at stuck with me all these years. So 
now I see that everything seems to be connected, 
and all that I have ever experienced is still affecting 
me today. Wow! I have to go home and sit with all 
of this.
As Gwen leaves my office, I tell her to pay attention to 
her dreams and keep a dream journal for the next week 
so we can continue to explore the unconscious mate-
rial through the symbols in her dreams. Gwen smiles 
and says she had no idea therapy would be like this. I 
remind her that psychoanalytically oriented therapy is 
a long journey and that she is not alone.
It is important for me to be aware of transference 
(Gwen’s  unconscious  reactions  to  me).  My  awareness  
of  transference  can  facilitate  Gwen’s  deepening  con-
nection  to  her  past.  It  is  also  important  for  me  to  be  
aware  of  countertransference  (my  unconscious  reac-
tions to Gwen). As Gwen spoke of getting spanked as 
a child, I could relate to her pain and felt her sadness. 
I  could  have  told  countless  stories  of  pain  inflicted  
upon  me  during  my  childhood,  but  it  is  not  my  ses-
sion.  However,  I  can  use  my  countertransference  in  a  
productive way by deepening my therapeutic relation-
ship  with  Gwen  and  showing  empathy  for  the  hurt  
child  that  she  was.  I  examine  the  feelings  and  sensa-
tions  that  came  up  for  me  in  the  session,  and  I  chal-
lenge  myself  to  seek  supervision  or  peer  consultation  
when  necessary  to  avoid  engaging  in  behavior  that  is  
not therapeutically beneficial.
Questions for Reflection
What interventions did the therapist make to help 
Gwen begin to see how her early experiences have 
an impact on her present behavior?

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Some major concepts of psychoanalytic theory include the dynamics of the 
unconscious and its influence on behavior, the role of anxiety, an understanding of 
transference and countertransference, and the development of personality at vari-
ous stages in the life cycle.
Erikson  broadened  Freud’s  developmental  perspective  by  including  psychoso-
cial trends. In his model, each of the eight stages of human development is charac-
terized by a crisis, or turning point. We can either master the developmental task or 
fail to resolve the core struggle (Table 4.2 compares Freud’s and Erikson’s views on 
the developmental stages).
Psychoanalytic  therapy  consists  largely  of  using  methods  to  bring  out  uncon-
scious  material  that  can  be  worked  through.  It  focuses  primarily  on  childhood  
experiences,  which  are  discussed,  reconstructed,  interpreted,  and  analyzed.  The  
assumption is that this exploration of the past, which is typically accomplished by 
working  through  the  transference  relationship  with  the  therapist,  is  necessary  for  
character change. The most important techniques typically employed in psychoana-
lytic  practice  are  maintaining  the  analytic  framework,  free  association,  interpreta-
tion, dream analysis, analysis of resistance, and analysis of transference.
Unlike Freudian theory, Jungian theory is not reductionist. Jung viewed humans 
positively  and  focused  on  individuation,  the  capacity  of  humans  to  move  toward  
wholeness and self-realization. To become what they are capable of becoming, indi-
viduals must explore the unconscious aspects of their personality, both the personal 
unconscious and the collective unconscious. In Jungian analytical therapy, the ther-
apist assists the client in tapping his or her inner wisdom. The goal of therapy is not 
merely the resolution of immediate problems but the transformation of personality.
The contemporary trends in psychoanalytic theory are reflected in these general 
areas:  ego  psychology,  object-relations  interpersonal  approaches,  self  psychology,  
and  relational  approaches.  Ego  psychology  does  not  deny  the  role  of  intrapsy-
chic  conflicts  but  emphasizes  the  striving  of  the  ego  for  mastery  and  competence  
throughout the human life span. The object-relations approaches are based on the 
notion that at birth there is no differentiation between others and self and that oth-
ers  represent  objects  of  need  gratification  for  infants.  Separation–individuation  is  
achieved  over  time.  When  this  process  is  successful,  others  are  perceived  as  both  
separate and related. Self psychology focuses on the nature of the therapeutic rela-
tionship, using empathy as a main tool. The relational approaches emphasize what 
evolves through the client–therapist relationship.
Contributions of the Classical Psychoanalytic Approach
I believe therapists can broaden their understanding of clients’ struggles by appre-
ciating Freud’s many significant contributions. It must be emphasized that compe-
tent use of psychoanalytic techniques requires training beyond what most therapists 
are given in their training program. The psychoanalytic approach provides practi-
tioners with a conceptual framework for looking at behavior and for understanding 
the origins and functions of symptoms. Applying the psychoanalytic point of view

to therapy practice is particularly useful in (1) understanding resistances that take 
the form of canceling appointments, fleeing from therapy prematurely, and refus-
ing  to  look  at  oneself;  (2)  understanding  that  unfinished  business  can  be  worked  
through, so that clients can provide a new ending to some of the events that have 
restricted them emotionally; (3) understanding the value and role of transference; 
and (4) understanding how the overuse of ego defenses, both in the counseling rela-
tionship and in daily life, can keep clients from functioning effectively.
Although there is little to be gained from blaming the past for the way a person 
is now or from dwelling on the past, considering the early history of a client is often 
useful in understanding and working with a client’s current situation. The client can 
use this awareness in making significant changes in the present and in future direc-
tions. Even though you may not agree with all of the premises of the classical psy-
choanalytic position, you can still draw on many of the psychoanalytic concepts as 
a framework for understanding your clients and for helping them achieve a deeper 
understanding of the roots of their conflicts.
Contributions of Contemporary Psychoanalytic Approaches
If the psychoanalytic (or psychodynamic) approach is considered in a broader context 
than is true of classical psychoanalysis, it becomes a more powerful and useful model 
for understanding human behavior. Although I find Freud’s psychosexual concepts 
of  value,  adding  Erikson’s  emphasis  on  psychosocial  factors  gives  a  more  complete  
picture of the critical turning points at each stage of development. Integrating these 
two  perspectives  is,  in  my  view,  most  useful  for  understanding  key  themes  in  the  
development of personality. Erikson’s developmental schema does not avoid the psy-
chosexual issues and stages postulated by Freud; rather, Erikson extends the stages of 
psychosexual development throughout life. His perspective integrates psychosexual 
and psychosocial concepts without diminishing the importance of either.
Therapists who work from a developmental perspective are able to see continu-
ity in life and to see certain directions their clients have taken. This perspective gives 
a  broader  picture  of  an  individual’s  struggle,  and  clients  are  able  to  discover  some  
significant connections among the various life stages.
The  contemporary  trends  in  psychoanalytic  thinking  contribute  to  the  under-
standing of how our current behavior in the world is largely a repetition of patterns set 
during one of the early phases of development. Object-relations theory helps us see the 
ways  in  which  clients  interacted  with  significant  others  in  the  past  and  how  they  are  
superimposing these early experiences on present relationships. For the many clients in 
therapy who are struggling with issues such as separation and individuation, intimacy, 
dependence versus independence, and identity, these newer formulations can provide 
a  framework  for  understanding  how  and  where  aspects  of  development  have  been  
fixated. They have significant implications for many areas of human interaction such as 
intimate relationships, the family and child rearing, and the therapeutic relationship.
In my opinion, it is possible to use key concepts of a psychodynamic framework to 
provide structure and direction to a counseling practice and at the same time to draw 
on other therapeutic techniques. I find value in the contributions of those writers who 
have built on the basic ideas of Freud and have added an emphasis on the social and cul-
tural dimensions affecting personality development. In contemporary psychoanalytic

practice,  more  latitude  is  given  to  the  therapist  in  using  techniques.  The  newer  psy-
choanalytic  theorists  have  enhanced,  extended,  and  refocused  classical  analytic  tech-
niques. They are concentrating on the development of the ego, are paying attention to 
the social and cultural factors that influence the differentiation of an individual from 
others, and are giving new meaning to the relational dimensions of therapy.
Several  meta-analyses  have  found  that  the  quality  of  the  therapeutic  relation-
ship and the therapeutic alliance are critical to the outcomes of analytic therapy, and 
research attests to the overall helpfulness of psychoanalytic treatments. McWilliams 
(2014)  admits  that  psychoanalytic  therapies  are  difficult  to  investigate  through  
randomized  controlled  trials  because  they  are  more  complex,  individualized,  and  
unstructured than many other therapy approaches. However, the professional com-
munity needs to appreciate the value of process research, qualitative research, case 
studies,  and  accumulated  clinical  wisdom.  McWilliams  cites  some  literature  on  
evidence-based  psychodynamic  therapy  and  adds  that  literature  is  emerging  that  
supports the efficacy of psychodynamic therapies. There is also extensive empirical 
literature on attachment, emotion, defenses, personality, and other areas that sup-
port the theoretical models and clinical experiences of psychoanalytic therapists.
Although  contemporary  psychodynamic  approaches  diverge  considerably  in  
many  respects  from  the  original  Freudian  emphasis  on  drives,  the  basic  Freudian  
concepts  of  unconscious  motivation,  the  influence  of  early  development,  transfer-
ence,  countertransference,  and  resistance  are  still  central  to  the  newer  psychody-
namic approaches. These concepts are of major importance in therapy and can be 
incorporated into therapeutic practices based on various theoretical approaches.
Limitations and Criticisms of Psychoanalytic Approaches
There are a number of practical limitations of psychoanalytic therapy. Considering 
factors such as time, expense, and availability of trained psychoanalytic therapists, 
the  practical  applications  of  many  psychoanalytic  techniques  are  limited.  This  is  
especially  true  of  methods  such  as  free  association  on  the  couch,  dream  analysis,  
and extensive analysis of the transference relationship. A factor limiting the practi-
cal  application  of  classical  psychoanalysis  is  that  many  severely  disturbed  clients  
lack the level of ego strength needed for this treatment.
A major limitation of traditional psychoanalytic therapy is the relatively long time 
commitment required to accomplish analytic goals. Contemporary psychoanalytically 
oriented therapists are interested in their clients’ past, but they intertwine that under-
standing with the present and with future goals. The emergence of brief, time-limited 
psychodynamic therapy is a partial response to the criticism of lengthy therapy. Psy-
chodynamic psychotherapy evolved from traditional analysis to address the need for 
treatment that was not so lengthy and involved (Luborsky et al., 2011).
A  potential  limitation  of  the  psychoanalytic  approach  is  the  anonymous  role  
assumed by some therapists. This stance can be justified on theoretical grounds, but 
in therapy situations other than classical psychoanalysis this stance is unduly restric-
tive. The newer formulations of psychoanalytic practice place considerable emphasis 
on the interaction between therapist and client in the here and now, and therapists 
can decide when and what to disclose to clients. Yalom (2003) suggests that appro-
priate  therapist  self-disclosure  tends  to  enhance  therapy  outcomes.  Rather  than

adopting a blank screen, he believes it is more productive to strive to understand the 
past as a way of shedding light on the dynamics of the present therapist–client rela-
tionship. This is in keeping with the spirit of the relational analytic approach, which 
emphasizes the here-and-now interaction between therapist and client.
From a feminist perspective there are distinct limitations to a number of Freudian 
concepts,  especially  the  Oedipus  and  Electra  complexes.  In  her  review  of  feminist  
counseling  and  therapy,  Enns  (1993)  also  notes  that  the  object-relations  approach  
has  been  criticized  for  its  emphasis  on  the  role  of  the  mother–child  relationship  in  
determining later interpersonal functioning. The approach gives great responsibility 
to mothers for deficiencies and distortions in development. Fathers are conspicuously 
absent  from  the  hypothesis  about  patterns  of  early  development;  only  mothers  are  
blamed for inadequate parenting. Linehan’s (1993a, 1993b, 2015) dialectical behavior 
therapy  (DBT),  addressed  in  some  detail  in  Chapter  9,  is  an  eclectic  approach  that  
avoids  mother  bashing  while  accepting  the  notion  that  the  borderline  client  experi-
enced a childhood environment that was “invalidating” (Linehan, 1993a, pp. 49–52).
Luborsky, O’Reilly-Landry, and Arlow (2011) note that psychoanalytic therapies 
have been criticized for being irrelevant to contemporary culture and being appro-
priate only to an elite, highly educated clientele. To this criticism, they counter with 
the following statement: “Psychoanalysis is a continually evolving field that has been 
revised  and  altered  by  psychoanalytic  theorists  and  clinicians  ever  since  its  origin.  
This  evolution  began  with  Freud  himself,  who  often  rethought  and  substantially  
revised his own ideas” (p. 27).
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What are a few key concepts of the relational psychoanalytic approach 
that you would be most likely integrate into your counseling practice?
2.
 Psychoanalytic therapists pay particular attention to early childhood 
experiences and the past as crucial determinants of present behavior. 
What are your thoughts about this emphasis? How does this concept 
apply to your life?
3.
 Transference can allow clients to explore the parallels between their 
past and present experience and to acquire a new understanding of 
their dynamics. What value would you place on exploring transference 
with a client?
4.
 What are some aspects of the psychoanalytic approach that you think 
could be applied to brief therapy or time-limited therapy?
5.
 What is one topic area that has the potential to trigger countertransfer-
ence for you? How can you identify your countertransference reactions? 
How can you best manage your countertransference as a therapist?

Recommended Supplementary Readings
Psychodynamic  Group  Psychotherapy  (Rutan,  Stone,  
& Shay, 2014) presents a comprehensive discussion 
of  various  facets  of  psychodynamic  group  therapy.  
Among the topics addressed are the stages of group 
development, the role of the group therapist, thera-
peutic factors accounting for change, working with 
difficult  groups  and  difficult  group  members,  and  
time-limited psychodynamic groups.
Brief  Dynamic  Therapy  (Levenson,  2010)  describes  
a  model  of  psychodynamic  therapy  that  fits  the  
reality of time-limited therapy and outlines the steps 
toward clinical work that is both focused and deep. 
The  book  deals  with  how  psychoanalytic  concepts  
and techniques can be modified to suit the needs of 
many  clients  who  cannot  participate  in  long-term  
therapy.
Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice (Gabbard, 
2005) offers an excellent account of various psycho-
analytic  perspectives  on  borderline  and  narcissistic  
disorders.

96            CHAPTER FIVE
ALFRED  ADLER  (1870–1937)  grew  up  in  
a  Vienna  family  of  six  boys  and  two  girls.  
His  younger  brother  died  at  a  very  young  
age in the bed next to Alfred. Adler’s early 
childhood  was  not  a  happy  time;  he  was  
sickly  and  very  much  aware  of  death.  At  
age 4 he almost died of pneumonia, and he 
heard the doctor tell his father that “Alfred 
is lost.” Adler associated this time with his 
decision to become a physician. Because he 
was ill so much during the first few years of 
his life, Adler was pampered by his mother. 
He  developed  a  trusting  relationship  with  
his father but did not feel very close to his mother. He 
was  extremely  jealous  of  his  older  brother,  Sigmund,  
which  led  to  a  strained  relationship  between  the  two  
during childhood and adolescence. When we consider 
Adler’s  strained  relationship  with  Sigmund  Freud,  we  
cannot  help  but  suspect  that  patterns  from  his  early  
family constellation were repeated in this relationship.
Adler’s   early   childhood   experiences   had   an   
impact on the formation of his theory. Adler shaped 
his  own  life  rather  than  leaving  it  to  fate.  Adler  was  
always  considered  bright,  but  he  did  just  enough  to  
get by in school until one day he realized that a math 
teacher did not know the answer to a question he had 
posed. Adler waited until the best students had given 
it  a  try,  and  then  he  raised  his  hand  and  stood  up.  
People laughed at him, but he came up with the right 
answer.  After  that  he  began  to  apply  himself,  and  
he  rose  to  the  top  of  his  class.  He  went  on  to  study  
medicine at the University of Vienna, entering private 
practice as an ophthalmologist, and then shifting to 
general  medicine.  He  eventually  specialized  in  neu-
rology  and  psychiatry,  and  he  had  a  keen  interest  in  
incurable childhood diseases.
Adler  experienced  anti-Semitism  and  the  hor-
rors  of  World  War  I.  Those  experiences,  and  the  
sociopolitical context of the time, contributed to his 
emphasis  on  humanism  and  the  need  for  people  to  
work  together.  He  was  acutely  aware  of  the  impact  
of context and culture on the human per-
sonality,  and  his  theory  emanated  from  
this awareness.
Adler  had  a  passionate  concern  for  
the   common   person   and   was   outspo-
ken  about  child-rearing  practices,  school  
reforms,  and  prejudices  that  resulted  in  
conflict.  He  spoke  and  wrote  in  simple,  
nontechnical   language   and   advocated   
for  children  at  risk,  women’s  rights,  the  
equality  of  the  sexes,  adult  education,  
community  mental  health,  family  coun-
seling,  and  brief  therapy  (Watts,  2012).  
Adler’s (1927/1959) Understanding Human Nature was 
the  first  major  psychology  book  to  sell  hundreds  of  
thousands  of  copies  in  the  United  States.  After  serv-
ing  in  World  War  I  as  a  medical  officer,  Adler  cre-
ated  32  child  guidance  clinics  in  the  Vienna  public  
schools  and  began  training  teachers,  social  workers,  
physicians, and other professionals. He pioneered the 
practice  of  teaching  professionals  through  live  dem-
onstrations  with  parents  and  children  before  large  
audiences,  now  called  “open-forum”  family  counsel-
ing.  The  clinics  he  founded  grew  in  number  and  in  
popularity, and he was indefatigable in lecturing and 
demonstrating his work.
Although Adler had an overcrowded work sched-
ule  most  of  his  professional  life,  he  still  took  some  
time to sing, enjoy music, and be with friends. In the 
mid-1920s  he  began  lecturing  in  the  United  States,  
and  he  later  made  frequent  visits  and  tours.  He  
ignored the warning of his friends to slow down, and 
on May 28, 1937, while taking a walk before a sched-
uled  lecture  in  Aberdeen,  Scotland,  Adler  collapsed  
and died of heart failure.

Adler’s  life,  see  Edward  Hoffman’s  (1996)  excellent

ings  and  their  meaning  in  modern  society,  see  Jon  
Carlson  and  Michael  Maniacci’s  (2012)  edited  book,  
Alfred Adler Revisited.
JON  D.  CARLSON  (b.  1945)  grew  up  in  a  Chicago  
suburb and was the youngest of four children. As the 
youngest  child  at  home  and  at  school,  he  struggled  
with  inferiority.  According  to  Adler,  youngest  chil-
dren  strive  to  belong  to  the  adult  world  and  over-
achieve, and Carlson fit that pattern. As a youngster 
he  had  asthma  and  serious  allergies  that  often  kept  
him  housebound,  but  he  eventually  “out  grew”  the  
breathing issues and compensated by becoming a com-
petitive distance runner and university coach, earning 
several  national  awards.  He  has  authored  or  edited  
more  than  60  books  and  300  professional  training

of  clinical  practice.  He  earned  two  doc-
toral  degrees  in  counseling  and  clinical  
psychology, as well as the prestigious Cer-
tificate  of  Psychotherapy  from  the  Adler  
School  in  Chicago.  Presently,  Jon  Carl-
son  holds  the  position  of  Distinguished  
Professor of Adlerian Psychology at Adler 
University  in  Chicago.  Carlson  received  
lifetime  contribution  awards  from  the  
APA,  ACA,  and  NASAP  and  was  named  
a  “Living  Legend  in  Counseling”  by  the  
ACA in 2004.
Carlson   believes   professional   counselors   and   
psychotherapists  should  be  models  of  mental  health  
and  authentic  in  all  that  they  do  and  say,  whether  
inside  the  consulting  room  or  out.  “I  take  pride  in  
having  been  married  to  Laura  for  five  decades  and  
having  good  relationships  with  all  five  of  
our children. I served for over 30 years as 
a  school  counselor/psychologist  in  our  
neighborhood  public  school.  I  have  prac-
ticed  as  couples  and  family  therapist  and  
have  participated  on  the  faculty  of  the  
Evolution  of  Psychotherapy  Conference  
demonstrating   psychotherapy   from   an   
Adlerian perspective.”
Carlson    doubts    that    even    Adler    
himself   would   be   an   Adlerian   today.   
In  Carlson’s  work  as  editor  of  the  Jour-
nal  of  Individual  Psychology  and  keynote  
speaker   at   several   Adlerian   conferences,   he   has   
encouraged  professionals  to  go  “on  beyond  Adler”  
and integrate Adler’s ideas with the many other valu-
able  approaches  available  in  contemporary  psycho-
therapy and counseling.
JAMES  ROBERT  BITTER  (b.  1947),  coau-
thor of this chapter, is one of the leading 
contemporary figures in Adlerian therapy. 
He  grew  up  in  Wenatchee,  Washington,  
the  oldest  of  two  children,  both  adopted.  
While  still  in  high  school,  Manford  Son-
stegard, a student and colleague of Rudolf 
Dreikurs,  started  a  family  education  cen-
ter  in  his  town.  Sonstegard  would  later  
become   Bitter’s   mentor,   teaching   him   
how to be an effective counselor.
Bitter’s  mother  died  of  cancer  when  
he  was  14  years  old,  and  he  felt  he  was  
largely  on  his  own  in  high  school  and  college.  An  
underachiever in everything, after his sophomore year 
in college, a friend challenged him to approach learn-
ing seriously and take charge of his life. Bitter began 
to achieve in both academic work and extracurricular 
activities.
Introduced   to   Adlerian   family   counseling   in   
the1970s by Professor Tom Edgar, Bitter and other stu-
dents at Idaho State University opened the first family 
education  center  in  Idaho.  Bitter  received  a  master’s  
degree and a doctorate at Idaho State University, then 
took  a  job  at  the  West  Virginia  College  of  Graduate  
Studies  in  a  counseling  program  chaired  by  Man-
ford  Sonstegard.  Over  the  next  13  years,  together  
they taught courses, ran workshops and conferences, 
wrote  papers  and  edited  a  journal,  and  developed  an  
Adlerian   model   for   group   counseling   
(Sonstegard & Bitter, 2004).
After  a  month-long  training  session  
led by Virginia Satir in 1979, Bitter became 
part  of  Satir’s  AVANTA  Network.  For  the  
next  nine  years,  Bitter  helped  lead  Satir’s  
training  sessions.  In  1987,  Satir  came  to  
California  State  University  at  Fullerton  to  
help Bitter initiate a new era in the counsel-
ing program there. At Fullerton Bitter met 
Jerry Corey, who encouraged Bitter to con-
tribute  to  this  book  as  well  as  to  write  his  
own books, one of which is Theory and Prac-
tice  of  Family  Therapy  and  Counseling  (Bitter,  2014).  This  
collaboration and friendship with Corey has continued 
for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century.  Bitter  will  serve  
as president of the North American Society of Adlerian 
Psychology (NASAP) in 2017 and 2018.
Bitter is an Adlerian integrationist, like his friend 
Jon Carlson. He integrates ideas gathered from other 
people,  but  his  foundation  remains  in  the  systemic  
therapeutic  practice  of  Adlerian  psychology.  Bitter  
believes  Adler’s  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  com-
munity  feeling  and  acting  with  social  interest  are  what  
guarantees mental health and helps people overcome 
inferiority feelings and know that they have a place in 
the world. Bitter brings his philosophy and practical 
experience  to  the  discussion  of  Adlerian  theory  and  
practice in this chapter.

98            CHAPTER FIVE
Introduction
Along  with  Freud  and  Jung,  Alfred  Adler  was  a  major  contributor  to  the  initial  
development of the psychodynamic approach to therapy. After a decade of collabo-
ration, Freud and Adler parted company, with Freud declaring that Adler was a her-
etic who had deserted him. Adler resigned as president of the Vienna Psychoanalytic 
Society in 1911 and founded the Society for Individual Psychology in 1912. Freud 
then asserted that it was not possible to support Adlerian concepts and still remain 
in good standing as a psychoanalyst.
Later, a number of other psychoanalysts deviated from Freud’s orthodox posi-
tion. These Freudian revisionists—including Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, and Harry 
Stack Sullivan—agreed that relational, social, and cultural factors were of great sig-
nificance  in  shaping  personality.  Even  though  these  three  therapists  are  typically  
called neo-Freudians, it would be more appropriate, as Heinz Ansbacher (1979) has 
suggested, to refer to them as neo-Adlerians because they moved away from Freud’s 
biological  and  deterministic  point  of  view  and  toward  Adler’s  social-psychological  
and teleological (or goal-oriented) view of human nature.
Adler  stresses  the  unity  of  personality,  contending  that  people  can  only  be  
understood as integrated and complete beings. This view also espouses the purpose-
ful nature of behavior, emphasizing that where we have come from is not as impor-
tant  as  where  we  are  striving  to  go.  Adler  saw  people  as  both  the  creators  and  the  
creations  of  their  own  lives;  that  is,  people  develop  a  unique  style  of  living  that  is  
both a movement toward and an expression of their selected goals. In this sense, we 
create ourselves rather than merely being shaped by our childhood experiences.
After Adler’s death in 1937, Rudolf Dreikurs was the most significant figure in 
bringing Adlerian psychology to the United States, especially as its principles applied 
to  education,  parenting,  individual  and  group  therapy,  and  family  counseling.  
Dreikurs  is  credited  with  giving  impetus  to  the  idea  of  child  guidance  centers  and  
to training professionals to work with a wide range of clients (Terner & Pew, 1978).

Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
Adler abandoned Freud’s basic theories because he believed Freud was exces-
sively  narrow  in  his  emphasis  on  biological  and  instinctual  determination.  Adler  
believed that the individual begins to form an approach to life somewhere in the first 
six  years  of  living.  He  focused  on  the  person’s  past  as  perceived  in  the  present  and  
how  an  individual’s  interpretation  of  early  events  continued  to  influence  that  per-
son’s present behavior. According to Adler, humans are motivated primarily by social 
relatedness rather than by sexual urges; behavior is purposeful and goal-directed; and 
consciousness,  more  than  unconsciousness,  is  the  focus  of  therapy.  Adler  stressed  
choice  and  responsibility,  meaning  in  life,  and  the  striving  for  success,  completion,  
and  perfection.  Adler  and  Freud  created  very  different  theories,  even  though  both

men grew up in the same city in the same era and were educated as physicians at the 
same  university.  Their  individual  and  distinct  childhood  experiences,  their  personal  
struggles, and the populations with whom they worked were key factors in the devel-
opment of their particular views of human nature (Schultz & Schultz, 2013).
Adler’s theory starts with a consideration of inferiority feelings, which he saw as 
a normal condition of all people and as a source of all human striving. Rather than 
being considered a sign of weakness or abnormality, inferiority feelings can be the 
wellspring of creativity. They motivate us to strive for mastery, success (superiority), 
and  completion.  We  are  driven  to  overcome  our  sense  of  inferiority  and  to  strive  
for increasingly higher levels of development (Ansbacher & Ansbacher, 1956/1964). 
Indeed, at around 6 years of age our fictional vision of ourselves as perfect or com-
plete begins to form into a life goal. The life goal unifies the personality and becomes 
the source of human motivation; every striving and every effort to overcome inferi-
ority is now in line with this goal.
From the Adlerian perspective, human behavior is neither determined by hered-
ity nor environment. Instead, we have the capacity to interpret, influence, and create 
events.  Adler  asserted  that  genetics  and  heredity  are  not  as  important  as  what  we  
choose to do with the abilities and limitations we possess. Freud viewed people as 
being  fixed  by  their  early  experiences,  whereas  Adler  believed  people  could  change  
through  social  learning.  Although  Adlerians  reject  a  deterministic  stance,  they  do  
not  go  to  the  other  extreme  and  maintain  that  individuals  can  become  whatever  
they want to be. Adlerians recognize that biological and environmental conditions 
limit our capacity to choose and to create.
Adlerians put the focus on reeducating individuals and reshaping society. Adler 
was the forerunner of a subjective approach to psychology that focuses on internal 
determinants of behavior such as values, beliefs, attitudes, goals, interests, and the 
individual  perception  of  reality.  He  was  a  pioneer  of  an  approach  that  is  holistic,  
social,  goal  oriented,  systemic,  and  humanistic.  Adler  was  the  first  systemic  thera-
pist: he maintained that it is essential to understand people within the systems in 
which they live.
Subjective Perception of Reality
Adlerians attempt to view the world from the client’s subjective frame of reference, 
an orientation described as phenomenological. Paying attention to the individual 
way in which people perceive their world, referred to as “subjective reality,” includes 
the  individual’s  perceptions,  thoughts,  feelings,  values,  beliefs,  convictions,  and  
conclusions. Behavior is understood from the vantage point of this subjective per-
spective. From the Adlerian perspective, objective reality is less important than how 
we interpret reality and the meanings we attach to what we experience.
Unity and Patterns of Human Personality
Adler chose the name individual Psychology (from the Latin, individuum, meaning 
indivisible) for his theoretical approach because he wanted to avoid Freud’s reduc-
tionist  divisions  such  as  ego,  id,  and  superego.  For  Adler,  Individual  Psychology  
meant indivisible  psychology.  Adler  emphasized  the  unity  and  indivisibility  of  the  
person  and  stressed  understanding  the  whole  person  in  the  context  of  his  or  her

life—how all dimensions of a person are interconnected components, and how all of 
these components are unified by the individual’s movement toward a life goal. This 
holistic concept implies that we cannot be understood in parts; rather, all aspects 
of ourselves must be understood in relationship to the socially embedded contexts 
of family, culture, school, and work (Carlson & Johnson, 2016). We are social, cre-
ative, decision-making beings who act with purpose and cannot be fully known out-
side the contexts that have meaning in our lives (Sherman & Dinkmeyer, 1987).
The human personality becomes unified through development of a life goal. An 
individual’s thoughts, feelings, beliefs, convictions, attitudes, character, and actions 
are expressions of his or her uniqueness, and all reflect a plan of life that allows for 
movement toward a self-selected life goal. An implication of this holistic view of person-
ality is that the client is an integral part of a social system. There is more emphasis 
on interpersonal relationships than on the individual’s internal psychodynamics.
Behavior  as  Purposeful  and  Goal  Oriented  Individual  Psychology  assumes  
that all human behavior has a purpose, and this purposefulness is the cornerstone 
of   Adler’s   theory.   Adler   replaced   deterministic   explanations   with   teleological   
(purposive, goal-oriented) ones. A basic assumption of Individual Psychology is that 
we can only think, feel, and act in relation to our goal; we can be fully understood only 
in light of knowing the purposes and goals toward which we are striving. Although 
Adlerians are interested in the future, they do not minimize the importance of past 
influences. They assume that most decisions are based on the person’s experiences, 
on the present situation, and on the direction in which the person is moving—with 
the latter being the most important. They look for continuity by paying attention 
to themes running through a person’s life.
Adler was influenced by the philosopher Hans Vaihinger (1965), who noted that 
people often live by fictions (or views of how the world should be). People form cog-
nitive assumptions (or fictions) that serve as a map of the world. Many Adlerians use 
the  term  fictional  finalism  to  refer  to  an  imagined  life  goal  that  guides  a  person’s  
behavior. It should be noted, however, that Adler ceased using this term and replaced 
it with “guiding self-ideal” and “goal of perfection” to account for our striving toward 
superiority  or  perfection.  Adler’s  concept  of  striving  for  perfection  implies  striving  for  
greater competence, not only for oneself but for the common good of others (Bitter, 
2012; Watts, 2012). Very early in life, we begin to envision what we might be like if we 
were successful, complete, whole, or perfect. Applied to human motivation, a guiding 
self-ideal might be expressed in this way: “Only when I am perfect can I be secure” or 
“Only when I am important can I be accepted.” The guiding self-ideal represents an 
individual’s image of a goal of perfection, for which he or she strives in any given situ-
ation. Because of our subjective final goal, we have the creative power to choose what 
we will accept as truth, how we will behave, and how we will interpret events.
Striving  for  Significance  and  Superiority  Adler  stressed  that  the  recognition  
of  inferiority  feelings  and  the  consequent  striving  for  perfection  or  mastery  are  
innate  (Ansbacher  &  Ansbacher,  1979);  they  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin.  To  
understand human behavior, it is essential to grasp the ideas of basic inferiority and 
compensation. From our earliest years, we need adults to care for us, but this is not 
a negative factor in life. According to Adler, the moment we experience inferiority,

we are pulled by the striving for superiority. For example, when the toddler learns 
to  walk  or  grab  a  crayon,  there  is  often  an  accompanying  triumphant  smile  or  
shout. This victory over inferiority is a step on the path of striving for superiority. 
Adler maintained that the goal of success pulls people forward toward mastery and 
enables them to overcome obstacles.
The goal of superiority contributes to the development of human community. 
However, it is important to note that “superiority,” as used by Adler, does not neces-
sarily mean superiority over others. Rather, it means moving from a perceived lower 
(or  minus)  position  to  a  perceived  better  (or  plus)  position  in  relation  to  oneself.  
People  cope  with  feelings  of  helplessness  by  striving  for  competence,  self-mastery,  
and perfection. They can seek to change a weakness into a strength, for example, or 
strive to excel in one area to compensate for defects in other areas. The unique ways 
in which people develop a style of striving for competence is what constitutes indi-
viduality or lifestyle. The manner in which Adler reacted to his childhood and ado-
lescent experiences of loss, rejection, and poor academic grades is a living example of 
this aspect of his theory.
Lifestyle  The  movement  from  a  felt  minus  to  a  desired  plus  results  in  the  
development of a life goal, which in turn unifies the personality and the individual’s 
core  beliefs  and  assumptions.  These  core  beliefs  and  assumptions  guide  each  
person’s movement through life and organize his or her reality, giving meaning to 
life events. Adler called this life movement the individual’s “lifestyle.” Synonyms for 
this term include “plan of life,” “style of life,” “strategy for living,” and “road map 
of life.” Lifestyle, often described as our perceptions regarding self, others, and the 
world, includes the connecting themes and rules of interaction that give meaning to 
our actions. It is the characteristic way we think, act, feel, perceive, and live (Carlson 
& Johnson, 2016).
Adler  saw  us  as  actors,  creators,  and  artists.  Understanding  one’s  lifestyle  is  
somewhat like understanding the style of a composer: “We can begin wherever we 
choose: every expression will lead us in the same direction—toward the one motive, 
the one melody, around which the personality is built” (Adler, as cited in Ansbacher 
& Ansbacher, 1956/1964, p. 332).
People  are  viewed  as  adopting  a  proactive,  rather  than  a  reactive,  approach  to  
their social environment. Although events in the environment influence the devel-
opment of personality, such events are not the causes of what people become; rather, 
it is our interpretation of these events that shape personality. Faulty interpretations 
may lead to mistaken notions in our private logic, which will significantly influence 
present behavior. Once we become aware of the patterns and continuity of our life, 
we are in a position to modify those faulty assumptions and make basic changes. We 
can reframe childhood experiences and consciously create a new style of living.
Social Interest and Community Feeling
Social  interest  and  community  feeling  (Gemeinschaftsgefühl)  are  probably  
Adler’s    most  significant  and  distinctive  concepts  (Ansbacher,  1992).  These  terms  
refer to individuals’ awareness of being part of the human community and to indi-
viduals’ attitudes in dealing with the social world.

social  interest  is  the  action  line  of  one’s  community  feeling,  and  it  involves  
being as concerned about others as one is about oneself. This concept involves the 
capacity to cooperate and contribute to something bigger than oneself (Milliren & 
Clemmer, 2006). Social interest requires that we have enough contact with the pres-
ent to make a move toward a meaningful future, that we are willing to give and to 
take, and that we develop our capacity for contributing to the welfare of others and 
strive for the betterment of humanity.
The  socialization  process  associated  with  social  interest  begins  in  childhood  
and involves helping children find a place in society and acquire a sense of belong-
ing (Kefir, 1981). While Adler considered social interest to be innate, he also believed 
that  it  must  be  learned,  developed,  and  used.  Adler  equated  social  interest  with  a  
sense  of  identification  and  empathy  with  others:  “to  see  with  the  eyes  of  another,  
to hear with the ears of another, to feel with the heart of another” (as cited in Ans-
bacher & Ansbacher, 1979, p. 42; also see Clark, 2007). For Adlerians, social interest 
is  the  central  indicator  of  mental  health.  Those  with  social  interest  tend  to  direct  
their  striving  toward  the  healthy  and  socially  useful  side  of  life.  As  social  interest  
develops, feelings of inferiority and alienation diminish. People express social inter-
est  through  shared  activity,  cooperation,  participation  in  the  common  good,  and  
mutual respect (Carlson & Johnson, 2016).
Individual  Psychology  rests  on  a  central  belief  that  our  happiness  and  success  
are largely related to this social connectedness. Because we are embedded in a soci-
ety,  and  indeed  in  the  whole  of  humanity,  we  cannot  be  understood  in  isolation  
from that social context. We are primarily motivated by a desire to belong. 
commu-
nity feeling embodies the feeling of being connected to all of humanity—past, pres-
ent, and future—and to being involved in making the world a better place. Community 
feeling  entails  the  evolutionary  need  to  belong,  and  it  manifests  itself  in  courage,  
empathy,  caring,  compassion,  engagement,  and  cooperation  (Bitter,  2012).  Those  
who lack this community feeling become discouraged and end up on the useless side 
of life. We seek a place in the family and in society to fulfill basic needs for security, 
acceptance, and worthiness. Many of the problems we experience are related to the 
fear of not being accepted by the groups we value. If our sense of belonging is not 
fulfilled, anxiety is the result. Only when we feel united with others are we able to act 
with courage in facing and dealing with our problems (Adler, 1938/1964).
The Life Tasks
Adler  taught  that  we  must  successfully  master  three  universal  life  tasks:  
building friendships (social task), establishing intimacy (love–marriage task), and 
contributing to society (occupational task). All people need to address these tasks, 
regardless  of  age,  gender,  time  in  history,  culture,  or  nationality.  Each  of  these  
tasks requires the development of psychological capacities for friendship and belong-
ing, for contribution and self-worth, and for cooperation (Bitter, 2007). These basic life 
tasks are so fundamental that impairment in any one of them is often an indica-
tor of a psychological disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Our per-
sonality is the result of stances we have taken in relation to the life tasks we face 
(Bitter, 2012). More often than not, when people seek therapy, it is because they 
are struggling unsuccessfully to meet one or more of these life tasks. The aim of

therapy is to encourage clients to develop increased social interest and to modify 
their lifestyle so they can more effectively navigate each of these life tasks (Carlson 
& Johnson, 2016).
Most  people  get  into  difficulty  when  they  lack  courage  and  seek  to  avoid  the  
demands posed by these life tasks. Adler (1929/1969) introduced “The Question” as 
a means of determining which life task a problem or symptom might be helping the 
person avoid. In its original form, the question asked was “What would you do if you 
were quite well?” (p. 201). If the person answered that he would complete his examina-
tions at school if not for his anxiety, Adler knew that the anxiety was needed for the 
person to avoid the possibility of failure.
Birth Order and Sibling Relationships
The Adlerian approach is unique in giving special attention to the relation-
ships  between  siblings  and  the  psychological  birth  position  in  one’s  family.  Adler  
identified five psychological positions, or vantage points, from which children tend 
to view life: oldest, second of only two, middle, youngest, and only. 
birth order is 
not a deterministic concept but does increase an individual’s probability of having a 
certain set of experiences. Actual birth order is less important than the individual’s 
interpretation, or the psychological position of the child’s place in the family. For 
example, the second born child (out of four) might experience the family from the 
psychological position of a youngest child if there is a 10-year gap before the next 
youngest child is born. And the third child might have the experience of a youngest 
child for her first 10 years of life. Because Adlerians view most human problems as 
social in nature, they emphasize relationships within the family as our earliest and, 
perhaps, our most influential social system.
Adler (1931/1958) observed that many people wonder why children in the same 
family often differ so widely, and he pointed out that it is a fallacy to assume that 
children of the same family are formed in the same environment. Although siblings 
share  aspects  in  common  in  the  family  constellation,  the  psychological  situation  
of each child is different from that of the others due to birth order. The following 
description  of  the  influence  of  birth  order  is  based  on  Ansbacher  and  Ansbacher  
(1964), Dreikurs (1953), and Adler (1931/1958).
1.
 The oldest child generally receives a good deal of attention, and during 
the time she is the only child, she is typically somewhat spoiled as the 
center of attention. She tends to be dependable and hard working and 
strives to keep ahead. When a new brother or sister arrives on the scene, 
however, she finds herself ousted from her favored position. She is no 
longer unique or special. She may readily believe that the newcomer 
(or intruder) will rob her of the love to which she is accustomed. Most 
often, she reasserts her position by becoming a model child, bossing 
younger children, and exhibiting a high achievement drive.
2.
 The second child of only two is in a different position. From the time she 
is born, she shares the attention with another child. The typical second 
child behaves as if she was in a race and is generally under full steam at 
all times. It is as though this second child were in training to surpass 
the older brother or sister. This competitive struggle between the first

two children influences the later course of their lives. The younger 
child develops a knack for finding out the elder child’s weak spots and 
proceeds to win praise from both parents and teachers by achieving 
successes where the older sibling has failed. If one is talented in a given 
area, the other strives for recognition by developing other abilities. The 
second-born is often opposite to the firstborn.
3.
 The middle child often feels squeezed out. This child may become 
convinced of the unfairness of life and feel cheated. This person may 
assume a “poor me” attitude and can become a problem child. How-
ever, especially in families characterized by conflict, the middle child 
may become the switchboard and the peacemaker, the person who 
holds things together. If there are four children in a family, the second 
child will often feel like a middle child and the third will be more 
easygoing, more social, and may align with the firstborn.
4.
 The youngest child is always the baby of the family and tends to be the 
most pampered one. Because of being pampered or spoiled, he may 
develop helplessness into an art form and become expert at putting 
others in his service. Youngest children tend to go their own way, often 
developing in ways no others in the family have attempted and may 
outshine everyone.
5.
 The only child has a problem of her own. Although she shares some of 
the characteristics of the oldest child (for example, a high achievement 
drive), she may not learn to share or cooperate with other children. She 
will learn to deal with adults well, as they make up her original famil-
ial world. Often, the only child is pampered by her parents and may 
become dependently tied to one or both of them. She may want to have 
center stage all of the time, and if her position is challenged, she will 
feel it is unfair.
Birth  order  and  the  interpretation  of  one’s  position  in  the  family  have  a  great  
deal to do with how adults interact in the world. Individuals acquire a certain style 
of  relating  to  others  in  childhood  and  form  a  definite  picture  of  themselves  that  
they  carry  into  their  adult  interactions.  In  Adlerian  therapy,  working  with  family  
dynamics, especially relationships among siblings, assumes a key role, but Adlerians 
do not dogmatically adopt the descriptions of birth order. It is important to avoid 
stereotyping individuals, but certain personality trends that began in childhood as a 
result of sibling rivalry can influence individuals throughout life.
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
Adlerian counseling and therapy rests on a collaborative arrangement between the 
client  and  the  counselor.  In  general,  the  therapeutic  process  includes  forming  a  
relationship based on mutual respect; a holistic psychological investigation or lifestyle 
assessment; and disclosing mistaken goals and faulty assumptions within the person’s 
style of living. This is followed by a reeducation or reorientation of the client toward

the  useful  side  of  life.  The  main  aim  of  therapy  is  to  develop  the  client’s  sense  of  
belonging  and  to  assist  in  the  adoption  of  behaviors  and  processes  characterized  
by  community  feeling  and  social  interest.  This  is  accomplished  by  increasing  the  
client’s self-awareness and challenging and modifying his or her fundamental prem-
ises, life goals, and basic concepts (Dreikurs, 1967, 1997).
Adlerians  favor  the  growth  model  of  personality,  with  an  emphasis  on  
strengths  and  well-being,  rather  than  a  pathology-based  medical  model.  The  
emphasis  is  on  health  and  prevention,  not  remediation.  Adlerian  theory  is  an  
optimistic perspective that views people as creative, unique, capable, and respon-
sible  (Watts,  2012,  2015).  Rather  than  being  stuck  in  some  kind  of  pathology,  
Adlerians  contend  that  clients  are  often  discouraged.  The  therapeutic  process  
focuses  on  providing  information,  teaching,  guiding,  and  offering  encourage-
ment to discouraged clients. Encouragement is the most powerful method avail-
able for changing a person’s beliefs, for it helps clients build self-confidence and 
stimulates courage. Courage is the willingness to act even when fearful in ways that 
are  consistent  with  social  interest.  Fear  and  courage  go  hand  in  hand;  without  
fear, there would be no need for courage. The loss of courage, or discouragement, 
results in mistaken and dysfunctional behavior. Discouraged people tend to act 
only in line with their perceived self-interest, which often is associated with a lack 
of social interest.
Adlerian counselors provide clients with an opportunity to view things from a 
different perspective, yet it is up to the clients to decide whether to accept an alterna-
tive perspective. Adlerians work collaboratively with clients to help them reach their 
self-defined  goals.  Adlerians  educate  clients  in  new  ways  of  looking  at  themselves,  
others,  and  life.  Through  the  process  of  providing  clients  with  a  new  “cognitive  
map,”  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  their  behavior,  counselors  
assist them in changing their perceptions. Maniacci, Sackett-Maniacci, and Mosak 
(2014) identify these goals for the educational process of therapy:
Fostering social interest by helping clients connect with their responsi-
bility to their community
Helping clients overcome feelings of discouragement and inferiority
Modifying clients’ lifestyle in the direction of becoming more adaptive, 
flexible, and social
Changing faulty motivation
Encouraging equality and acceptance of self and others
Helping people to become contributing members of the world 
community
Therapist’s Function and Role
Adlerian therapists realize that clients can become discouraged and function 
ineffectively because of mistaken beliefs, faulty values, and useless or self-absorbed 
goals.  Adlerians  operate  on  the  assumption  that  clients  will  feel  and  behave  bet-
ter  once  they  discover  and  correct  their  basic  mistakes.  Therapists  tend  to  look  
for  major  mistakes  in  thinking  and  valuing  such  as  mistrust,  selfishness,  unreal-
istic  ambitions,  and  lack  of  confidence.  In  addition  to  examining  basic  mistakes,  
Adlerian  therapists  often  help  clients  identify  and  explore  their  core  fears,  such

as being imperfect, being vulnerable, being disapproved of, or suffering from past 
regrets (Carlson & Englar-Carlson, 2013).
A  major  task  for  the  therapist  is  to  make  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  
client’s  functioning.  Therapists  often  gather  information  about  the  individual’s  
style  of  living  by  means  of  a  questionnaire  on  the  client’s  family  constellation, 
which includes parents, siblings, and others living in the home, life tasks, and early 
recollections. This is a time when the assessment of birth order might be appropri-
ate. When summarized and interpreted, this questionnaire renders the individual’s 
life story to this point in time. From this information on the family constellation, 
the  therapist  is  able  to  get  a  perspective  on  the  client’s  major  areas  of  success  and  
failure,  how  the  client  pursues  life  goals,  and  the  critical  influences  that  have  had  
a bearing on the role the client has assumed in the world. These influences include 
the cultural context and the sociopolitical reality in which the client lives (Carlson 
& Englar-Carlson, 2013).
The  counselor  also  uses  early  recollections  as  an  assessment  procedure.  
early 
recollections (ERs) are defined as “stories of events that a person says occurred [one 
time] before he or she was 10 years of age” (Mosak & Di Pietro, 2006, p. 1). ERs are 
specific incidents that clients recall, along with the feelings and thoughts that accom-
panied  these  childhood  incidents.  These  recollections  are  quite  useful  in  getting  a  
better understanding of the client (Clark, 2002). After these early recollections are 
summarized  and  interpreted,  the  therapist  identifies  some  of  the  major  successes  
and mistakes in the client’s life. The aim is to provide a point of departure for the 
therapeutic  venture.  ERs  are  particularly  useful  as  a  functional  assessment  device  
because they indicate what clients do and how they think in both adaptive and mal-
adaptive ways (Mosak & Di Pietro, 2006). The process of gathering early memories is 
part of what is called a lifestyle assessment, which involves learning to understand 
the goals and motivations of the client. When this process is completed, the thera-
pist and the client have targets for therapy.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
How do clients maintain their lifestyle, and why do they resist changing it? A per-
son’s  style  of  living  serves  the  individual  by  staying  stable  and  constant.  In  other  
words, it is predictable. It is, however, also resistant to change throughout most of 
one’s life. Generally, people fail to change because they do not recognize the errors 
in their thinking or the purposes of their behaviors, do not know what to do differ-
ently, and are fearful of leaving old patterns for new and unpredictable outcomes. 
Thus, even though their ways of thinking and behaving are not successful, they tend 
to cling to familiar patterns (Sweeney, 2009). Clients in Adlerian counseling focus 
their work on desired outcomes and a resilient lifestyle that can provide a new blue-
print for their actions.
In therapy, clients explore what Adlerians call private logic, the concepts about 
self, others, and life that constitutes the philosophy on which an individual’s lifestyle 
is based. Private logic involves our convictions and beliefs that get in the way of social 
interest and that do not facilitate useful, constructive belonging (Carlson, Watts, & 
Maniacci, 2006). Clients’ problems arise because the conclusions based on their pri-
vate  logic  often  do  not  conform  to  the  requirements  of  social  living.  The  heart  of

therapy is helping clients to discover the purposes of behaviors or symptoms and the 
basic mistakes associated with their personal coping. Learning how to correct faulty 
assumptions and conclusions is central to therapy.
To  provide  a  concrete  example,  think  of  a  chronically  depressed  middle-aged  
man  who  begins  therapy.  After  a  lifestyle  assessment  is  completed,  these  basic  
mistakes are identified:
He has convinced himself that nobody could really care about him.
He rejects people before they have a chance to reject him.
He is harshly critical of himself, expecting perfection.
He has expectations that things will rarely work out well.
He burdens himself with guilt because he is convinced he is letting 
everyone down.
Even though this man may have developed these mistaken beliefs about himself 
and life when he was young, he is still clinging to them as rules for living. His expec-
tations, most of which are pessimistic, tend to be fulfilled because on some level he 
is seeking to validate his beliefs. Indeed, his depression will eventually serve the pur-
pose of helping him avoid contact with others, a life task at which he expects to fail. 
In therapy, this man will learn how to challenge the structure of his private logic. In 
his case the syllogism goes as follows:
“I am basically unlovable.”
“The world is filled with people who are likely to be rejecting.”
“Therefore, I must keep to myself so I won’t be hurt.”
This person holds onto several basic mistakes, and his private logic offers a psycho-
logical focus for treatment. A central theme or convictions in this client’s life might 
be: “I must control everything in my life.” “I must be perfect in everything I do.”
It is easy to see how depression might follow from this thinking, but Adlerians 
also know that the depression serves as an excuse for this man’s retreat from life. It 
is important for the therapist to listen for the underlying purposes of this client’s 
behavior.  He  has  isolated  himself  from  any  community  feeling,  so  his  social  inter-
est is low. Adlerians see feelings as being aligned with thinking and as the fuel for 
behaving. First we think, then we feel, and then we act. Because emotions and cogni-
tions serve a purpose, a good deal of therapy time is spent in discovering and under-
standing this purpose and in reorienting the client toward effective ways of being. 
Because the client is not perceived by the therapist to be mentally ill or emotionally 
disturbed, but as mainly discouraged, the therapist will offer the client encourage-
ment so that change is possible. Through the therapeutic process, the client will dis-
cover that he or she has resources and options to draw on in dealing with significant 
life issues and life tasks.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Adlerians  consider  a  good  client–therapist  relationship  to  be  one  between  
equals  that  is  based  on  cooperation,  mutual  trust,  respect,  confidence,  collabora-
tion, and alignment of goals. They place special value on the counselor’s modeling 
of  communication  and  acting  in  good  faith.  From  the  beginning  of  therapy,  the

relationship  is  a  collaborative  one,  characterized  by  two  persons  working  equally  
toward specific, agreed-upon goals. Adlerian therapists strive to establish and main-
tain  an  egalitarian  therapeutic  alliance  and  a  person-to-person  relationship  with  
their clients. Developing a strong therapeutic relationship is essential to successful 
outcomes. Dinkmeyer and Sperry (2000) maintain that at the outset of therapy cli-
ents should begin to formulate a plan, or contract, detailing what they want, how 
they plan to get where they are heading, what is preventing them from successfully 
attaining their goals, how they can change nonproductive behavior into construc-
tive behavior, and how they can make full use of their assets in achieving their pur-
poses. This therapeutic contract sets forth the goals of the therapeutic process and 
specifies the responsibilities of both therapist and client. Developing a contract is 
not  a  requirement  of  Adlerian  therapy,  but  a  contract  can  bring  a  tight  focus  to  
therapy.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
Adlerian counseling is structured around four central objectives that corre-
spond to the four phases of the therapeutic process (Dreikurs, 1967).
1. Establish the proper therapeutic relationship.
2.
 Explore the psychological dynamics operating in the client (an 
assessment).
3. Encourage the development of self-understanding (insight into 
purpose).
4.
 Help the client make new choices (reorientation and reeducation).
These phases are not linear and do not progress in rigid steps; rather, they can best 
be understood as a weaving that leads to a tapestry. Dreikurs (1997) incorporated 
these  phases  into  what  he  called  minor  psychotherapy  in  the  context  and  service  of  
holistic  medicine.  His  approach  to  therapy  has  been  elaborated  in  what  is  now  
called 
adlerian brief therapy, or ABT (Bitter, Christensen, Hawes, & Nicoll, 1998). 
This way of working is discussed in the following sections.
Phase 1: Establish the Relationship
The  Adlerian  practitioner  works  in  a  collaborative  way  with  clients,  and  this  rela-
tionship  is  based  on  a  sense  of  interest  that  grows  into  caring,  involvement,  and  
friendship.  Therapeutic  progress  is  possible  only  when  there  is  an  alignment  of  
clearly  defined  goals  between  therapist  and  client.  The  counseling  process,  to  be  
effective,  must  deal  with  the  personal  issues  the  client  recognizes  as  significant  
and is willing to explore and change. The therapeutic efficacy in the later phases of 
Adlerian therapy is predicated upon the development and continuation of a solid 
therapeutic relationship during this first phase of therapy (Watts, 2015).
Adlerian therapists focus on making person-to-person contact with clients rather 
than starting with “the problem.” Clients’ concerns surface rather quickly in therapy, 
but  the  initial  focus  should  be  on  the  person,  not  the  problem.  One  way  to  create  
effective  contact  is  for  counselors  to  help  clients  become  aware  of  their  assets  and  
strengths  rather  than  dealing  continually  with  their  deficits  and  liabilities.  During

the initial phase, a positive relationship is created by listening, responding, demon-
strating  respect  for  clients’  capacity  to  understand  purpose  and  seek  change,  and  
exhibiting hope and caring. When clients enter therapy, they typically have a dimin-
ished sense of self-worth and self-respect. They lack faith in their ability to cope with 
the tasks of life, and they often feel discouraged. Therapists provide support, which 
is an antidote to despair and discouragement. For some people, therapy may be one 
of the few times in which they have truly experienced a caring human relationship.
Adlerians  pay  more  attention  to  the  subjective  experiences  of  the  client  than  
they  do  to  using  techniques.  During  the  initial  phase  of  counseling,  the  therapist  
works  to  understand  the  client’s  identity  and  experience  of  the  world.  Techniques  
are fitted to the needs of each client and may include attending and listening with 
empathy, following the subjective experience of the client as closely as possible, iden-
tifying and clarifying goals, and suggesting initial hunches about purpose in client’s 
symptoms, actions, and interactions. Adlerian counselors are generally active, espe-
cially during the initial sessions. They provide structure and assist clients in defining 
personal   goals,   conduct   psychological   assessments,   and   offer   interpretations   
(Carlson  et  al.,  2006).  Adlerians  attempt  to  grasp  both  the  verbal  and  nonverbal  
messages of the client; they want to access the core patterns in the client’s life. If the 
client feels deeply understood and accepted, the client is likely to focus on what he 
or  she  wants  from  therapy  and  thus  establish  goals.  At  this  stage  the  counselor’s  
function  is  to  provide  a  wide-angle  perspective  that  will  eventually  help  the  client  
view his or her world differently.
Phase 2: Assessing the Individual’s Psychological Dynamics
The aim of the second phase of Adlerian counseling is to get a deeper under-
standing of an individual’s lifestyle. During this assessment phase, the focus is on 
understanding  the  client’s  identity  and  how  that  identity  relates  to  the  world  at  
large. This assessment phase proceeds from two interview forms: the subjective inter-
view  and  the  objective  interview  (Dreikurs,  1997).  In  the  subjective  interview,  the  
counselor  helps  the  client  tell  his  or  her  life  story  as  completely  as  possible.  This  
process is facilitated by a generous use of empathic listening and responding. Active 
listening, however, is not enough. The subjective interview must follow from a sense 
of wonder, fascination, and interest. What the client says will spark an interest in the 
counselor and lead, naturally, to the next most significant question or inquiry about 
the client and his or her life story. Indeed, the best subjective interviews treat clients 
as experts in their own lives, allowing clients to feel completely heard. Throughout 
the subjective interview, the Adlerian counselor is listening for clues to the purpo-
sive aspects of the client’s coping and approaches to life. “The subjective interview 
should extract patterns in the person’s life, develop hypotheses about what works 
for the person, and determine what accounts for the various concerns in the client’s 
life” (Bitter et al., 1998, p. 98). Toward the end of this part of the interview, Adlerian 
brief therapists ask, “Is there anything else you think I should know to understand 
you and your concerns?”
An  initial  assessment  of  the  purpose  that  symptoms,  actions,  or  difficulties  
serve  in  a  person’s  life  can  be  gained  from  Dreikurs  (1997)  revision  of  “The  Ques-
tion.” Adlerians often end a subjective interview by asking, “How would your life be

different,  and  what  would  you  be  doing  differently,  if  you  did  not  have  this  symp-
tom  or  problem?”  Adlerians  use  this  question  to  help  with  differential  diagnosis.  
More  often,  the  symptoms  or  problems  experienced  by  the  client  help  the  client  
avoid something that is perceived as necessary but from which the person wishes to 
retreat, usually a life task: “If it weren’t for my depression, I would get out more and 
see my friends.” Such a statement betrays the client’s concern about the possibility 
of being a good friend or being welcomed by his or her friends. “I need to get mar-
ried,  but  how  can  I  with  these  panic  attacks?”  indicates  the  person’s  worry  about  
being  a  partner  in  a  marriage.  Depression  can  serve  as  the  client’s  solution  when  
faced with problems in relationships. If a client reports that nothing would be dif-
ferent, especially with physical symptoms, Adlerians suspect that the problem may 
be organic and require medical intervention.
The objective interview seeks to discover information about (a) how problems 
in the client’s life began; (b) any precipitating events; (c) a medical history, including 
current  and  past  medications;  (d)  a  social  history;  (e)  the  reasons  the  client  chose  
therapy at this time; (f) the person’s coping with life tasks; and (g) a lifestyle assess-
ment. Based on interview approaches developed by Adler and Dreikurs, the lifestyle 
assessment starts with an investigation of the person’s family constellation and early 
childhood history (Powers & Griffith, 2012a; Shulman & Mosak, 1988). Counselors 
also interpret the person’s early memories, seeking to understand the meaning that 
she  or  he  has  attached  to  life  experiences.  They  operate  on  the  assumption  that  it  
is  the  interpretations  people  develop  about  themselves,  others,  the  world,  and  life  
that govern what they do. Lifestyle assessment seeks to develop a holistic narrative 
of the person’s life, to make sense of the way the person copes with life tasks, and to 
uncover the private interpretations and logic involved in that coping. For example, 
if Jenny has lived most of her life in a critical environment, and now she believes she 
must be perfect to avoid even the appearance of failure, the assessment process will 
highlight the restricted living that flows from this perspective. Another example is 
Ramon who grew up as a child of undocumented immigrants. He lived most of his 
life in fear of his environment, and he tried to remain invisible and was wary of trust-
ing  others.  Now  he  struggles  to  connect  with  peers  and  to  maintain  a  committed  
relationship. The assessment process explores how his lifestyle is inconsistent with 
his stated goals of wanting connection.
The  Family  Constellation  Adler  considered  the  family  of  origin  as  having  a  
central impact on an individual’s personality. Adler suggested that it was through 
the family constellation that each person forms his or her unique view of self, others, 
and life. Factors such as cultural and familial values, gender-role expectations, and 
the nature of interpersonal relationships are all influenced by a child’s observation 
of the interactional patterns within the family. Adlerian assessment relies heavily on 
an exploration of the client’s family constellation, including the client’s evaluation 
of conditions that prevailed in the family when the person was a young child (family 
atmosphere),  birth  order,  parental  relationship  and  family  values,  and  extended  
family and culture. Some of these questions are almost always explored:
Who was the favorite child?
What was your father’s relationship with the children? Your mother’s?

Who among the siblings was most like you? In what ways?
What were you like as a child?
How did your parents get along? In what did they both agree? How did 
they handle disagreements? How did they discipline the children?
An investigation of family constellation is far more comprehensive than these few 
questions, but these questions give an idea of the type of information the counselor 
is seeking. The questions are always tailored to the individual client with the goal 
of  eliciting  the  client’s  perceptions  of  self  and  others,  of  development,  and  of  the  
experiences that have affected that development.
Early  Recollections  As  you  will  recall  from  the  section  on  the  therapist’s  
functions and role, another assessment procedure used by Adlerians is to ask the 
client to provide his or her earliest memories, including the age of the person at 
the time of the remembered events and the feelings or reactions associated with 
the recollections. Early recollections are one-time occurrences, usually before the 
age of 10, that can be pictured by the client in clear detail. Early recollections are 
a series of small mysteries that can be woven together into a tapestry that leads to 
an understanding of how we view ourselves, how we see the world, what our life 
goals are, what motivates us, what we value and believe in, and what we anticipate 
for our future (Clark, 2002; Mosak & Di Pietro, 2006). Adler reasoned that out of 
the  millions  of  early  memories  we  might  have  we  select  those  special  memories  
that project the essential convictions and even the basic mistakes of our lives. To 
a large extent, what we selectively attend to from the past is reflective of what we 
believe, how we behave in the present, and our anticipation of the future (Watts, 
2015).
Early memories cast light on the “story of our life” because they represent meta-
phors for our current views. From the thousands of experiences we have before the 
age of 10, we tend to remember only 6 to 12 memories. By understanding why we 
retain these memories and what they tell us about how we see ourselves, others, and 
life in the present, it is possible to get a clear sense of our mistaken notions, present 
attitudes, social interests, and possible future behavior. Early recollections are spe-
cific instances that clients tell therapists, and they are very useful in understanding 
those who are sharing a story (Mosak & Di Pietro, 2006). Exploring early recollec-
tions  involves  discovering  how  mistaken  notions  based  on  faulty  goals  and  values  
continue to create problems in a client’s life. Early recollections serve an organizing 
function in understanding the purposefulness of behavior, the style of life, striving 
for superiority, holism, and birth order (Clark, 2012).
To tap such recollections, the counselor might proceed as follows: “I would like 
to  hear  about  your  early  memories.  Think  back  to  when  you  were  very  young,  as  
early as you can remember (before the age of 10), and tell me something that happened 
one  time.  Be  sure  to  recall  something  you  remember,  not  something  you  were  told  
about by others.” After receiving each memory, the counselor might also ask: “What 
part stands out to you? What was the most vivid part of your early memory? If you 
played  the  whole  memory  like  a  movie  and  stopped  it  at  one  frame,  what  would

be happening? Putting yourself in that moment, what are you feeling? What’s your 
reaction?”  Three  memories  are  usually  considered  a  minimum  to  assess  a  pattern,  
and some counselors ask for as many as a dozen memories.
Adlerian  therapists  use  early  recollections  as  a  projective  technique  (Clark,  
2002;  Hays,  2013)  and  to  (a)  assess  the  client’s  convictions  about  self,  others,  life,  
and ethics; (b) assess the client’s stance in relation to the counseling session and the 
counseling relationship; (c) verify the client’s coping patterns; and (d) assess individ-
ual strengths, assets, and interfering ideas (Bitter et al., 1998, p. 99). In interpreting 
these early recollections, Adlerians may consider questions such as these:
What part does the client take in the memory? Is the client an observer 
or a participant?
Who else is in the memory? What position do others take in relation to 
the client?
What are the dominant themes and overall patterns of the memories?
What feelings are expressed in the memories?
Why does the client choose to remember this event? What is the client 
trying to convey?
Let’s try this out. Here are three memory stories and some guesses about what these 
memories might mean.
Memory 1: “I was 4 years old. We were staying at grandma and grandpa’s 
house. I got to sleep in the attic, and it had a neat hole from which I could 
spy on the adults below. I could see and hear them, but they could not see 
me. I love being sneaky.
Interpretation: I like to (a) be on top of things; (b) know what’s going on—
even if it’s none of my business; and (c) I like to be an observer.
Memory 2: I am 8 years old. It is summer. My father wants to take me 
with him to a baseball game, but I am not around. I am off playing where 
I should not be, and my mom can’t find me. I miss out on going with my 
dad. I cry when I am told, and I am sad.
Interpretation: If I do things I am not supposed to do, even if I am having 
fun, I might miss out on something even more fun.
Memory 3: I am in the second or third grade, maybe 8 or 9. I am asked to 
come to the blackboard and work out a problem. I remember how to do it 
mostly. I get almost to the end, but I cannot complete it. Someone else has 
to come up and complete it, and I miss out on getting to the right answer. 
I am watching Gary Snitley complete the problem, and I am disappointed 
that I didn’t remember it.
Interpretation: There is always someone out there who is smarter than me. 
If I am going to do something and get credit for it, I better do it all and do 
it right the first time; there is no room for error.
Can you match these tentative interpretations with the details offered in each mem-
ory story?

Integration and Summary Once material has been gathered from both subjective 
and  objective  interviews  with  the  client,  integrated  summaries  of  the  data  are  
developed. Different summaries are prepared for different clients, but common ones 
are a narrative summary of the person’s subjective experience and life story; a summary 
of  family  constellation  and  developmental  data;  a  summary  of  early  recollections,  
personal strengths or assets, and interfering ideas; and a summary of coping strategies. 
The summaries are presented to the client and discussed in the session, with the client 
and  the  counselor  together  refining  specific  points.  This  information  provides  the  
client with the chance to discuss specific topics and to raise questions.
The Student Manual that accompanies this textbook includes a concrete exam-
ple of the lifestyle assessment as it is applied to the case of Stan. In Case Approach to 
Counseling  and  Psychotherapy  (Corey,  2013,  chap.  3),  Drs.  Jim  Bitter  and  Bill  Nicoll  
present a lifestyle assessment of another hypothetical client, Ruth.
Phase 3: Encourage Self-Understanding and Insight
During  this  third  phase,  Adlerian  therapists  interpret  the  findings  of  the  
assessment  as  an  avenue  for  promoting  self-understanding  and  insight.  When  
Adlerians  speak  of  insight,  they  are  referring  to  an  understanding  of  the  motiva-
tions  that  operate  in  a  client’s  life.  Self-understanding  is  only  possible  when  hid-
den purposes and goals of behavior are made conscious. Adlerians consider insight 
as  a  special  form  of  awareness  that  facilitates  a  meaningful  understanding  within  
the  therapeutic  relationship  and  acts  as  a  foundation  for  change.  Insight  without  
action is not enough. Insight is a means to an end, and not an end in itself. People 
can make rapid and significant changes without much insight.
Disclosure and well-timed interpretations are techniques that facilitate the pro-
cess  of  gaining  insight.  
interpretation  deals  with  clients’  underlying  motives  for  
behaving the way they do in the here and now. Adlerian disclosures and interpreta-
tions are concerned with creating awareness of one’s direction in life, one’s goals and 
purposes, one’s private logic and how it works, and one’s current behavior.
Adlerian  interpretations  are  suggestions  presented  tentatively  in  the  form  of  
open-ended  questions  that  can  be  explored  in  the  sessions.  They  are  hunches  or  
guesses, and they often begin with phrases such as “I could be wrong, but I am won-
dering if ... ,” “Could it be that ... ,” or “Is it possible that ...” Because interpretations 
are presented in this manner, clients are not led to defend themselves, and they feel 
free  to  discuss  and  even  argue  with  the  counselor’s  hunches  and  impressions.  
Through this process, both counselor and client eventually come to understand the 
client’s  motivations,  the  ways  in  which  these  motivations  are  now  contributing  to  
the maintenance of the problem, and what the client can do to correct the situation. 
During this phase of therapy, the counselor helps the client understand the limita-
tions of the style of life the client has chosen.
Phase 4: Reorientation and Reeducation
The  final  stage  of  the  therapeutic  process  is  the  action-oriented  phase  
known as reorientation and reeducation: putting insights into practice. This phase 
focuses on helping clients discover a new and more functional perspective. Clients 
are both encouraged and challenged to develop the courage to take risks and make

changes in their life. During this phase, clients can choose to adopt a new style of life 
based on the insights they gained in the earlier phases of therapy. More commonly, 
clients figure out how to reorient their current style of living to the useful side of 
life, increasing their community feeling and social interest. The useful side involves 
a sense of belonging and being valued, having an interest in others and their welfare, 
courage, the acceptance of imperfection, confidence, a sense of humor, a willingness 
to contribute, and an outgoing friendliness. The useless side of life is characterized 
by self-absorption, withdrawal from life tasks, self-protection, or acts against one’s 
fellow human beings. People acting on the useless side of life become less functional 
and  are  more  susceptible  to  psychopathology.  Adlerian  therapy  stands  in  opposi-
tion to self-depreciation, isolation, and retreat, and it seeks to help clients gain cour-
age and to connect to strengths within themselves, to others, and to life.
reorientation  involves  shifting  rules  of  interaction,  process,  and  motivation.  
These  shifts  are  facilitated  through  changes  in  awareness,  which  often  occur  
during  the  therapy  session  and  which  are  transformed  into  action  outside  of  the  
therapy office (Bitter & Nicoll, 2004). In addition, especially at this phase of therapy, 
Adlerians focus on reeducation (see the section Therapeutic Goals). Throughout this 
phase, no intervention is more important than encouragement.
The  Encouragement  Process  Encouragement  is  the  most  distinctive  Adlerian  
procedure, and it is central to all phases of counseling and therapy. It is especially 
important as people consider change in their lives. 
encouragement literally means 
“to  build  courage.”  Encouragement  is  a  process  of  increasing  the  courage  needed  
for  a  person  to  face  difficulties  in  life  (Carlson  &  Englar-Carlson,  2013).  Courage  
develops when people become aware of their strengths, when they feel they belong 
and are not alone, and when they have a sense of hope and can see new possibilities 
for themselves and their daily living. Therapists help clients focus on their resources 
and  strengths  and  to  have  faith  that  they  can  make  life  changes,  even  though  life  
can be difficult. Milliren, Evans, and Newbauer (2007) consider encouragement key 
in  promoting  and  activating  social  interest.  They  add  that  encouragement  is  the  
universal therapeutic intervention for Adlerian counselors, that it is a fundamental 
attitude,  or  way  of  being,  rather  than  a  technique.  Because  clients  often  do  not  
recognize or accept their positive qualities, strengths, or internal resources, one of 
the counselor’s main tasks is to help them do so.
Adlerians  believe  discouragement  is  the  basic  condition  that  prevents  people  
from  functioning,  and  they  see  encouragement  as  the  antidote.  As  a  part  of  the  
encouragement process, Adlerians use a variety of relational, cognitive, behavioral, 
emotional,  and  experiential  techniques  to  help  clients  identify  and  challenge  self-
defeating  cognitions,  generate  perceptional  alternatives,  and  make  use  of  assets,  
strengths, and resources (Ansbacher & Ansbacher, 1964; Watts, 2015).
Encouragement  takes  many  forms,  depending  on  the  phase  of  the  counseling  
process. In the relationship phase, encouragement results from the mutual respect 
the  counselor  seeks  to  engender.  Here  is  an  opening  intervention  focusing  on  
encouragement:
 Client:  I almost didn’t come . . .
 Counselor:  . . . but you did.

 Client:  Yes, but I just don’t know. Maybe it would have been better 
just to end it all, not even bother.
 Counselor:  So you are in a lot of pain, even thinking about ending it all, 
but still you came. That took a lot of courage, How did you 
manage to summon that courage and then act on it?
In the assessment phase, which is partially designed to illuminate personal strengths, 
clients are encouraged to recognize that they are in charge of their own lives and can 
make different choices based on new understandings.
During reorientation, encouragement comes when new possibilities are gener-
ated  and  when  clients  are  acknowledged  and  affirmed  for  taking  positive  steps  to  
change their lives for the better. This later intervention focused on encouragement 
has a triumphant tone:
 Counselor:  Let me see if I understand this. You were in a familiar 
family setting. Your father was berating you about a minor 
difference of opinion, really trying to push your buttons, and 
you managed not only to stay calm but also offered to help 
him sort some materials in his office. You must feel so proud 
of yourself, triumphant even. What a transformation of your 
normal interactions.
 Client:  Yes, and I even walked away feeling I had made a difference 
in his life. I did not lose my temper. I did not strike back. I 
actually just heard him in a different way, knew he needed 
to feel right and important, and when I let that happen, 
everything changed between us.
 Counselor:  You even know the steps that got you there.
 Client:  Yes, I do.
 Counselor:  Achieving a change in long-held family patterns is one of the 
hardest things to attain. You have a right to feel delighted.
Change  and  the  Search  for  New  Possibilities  During  the  reorientation  phase  
of counseling, clients make decisions and modify their goals. They are encouraged 
to act as if they were the people they want to be, which can serve to challenge self-
limiting assumptions. Clients are asked to catch themselves in the process of repeating 
old  patterns  that  have  led  to  ineffective  behavior  (Watts,  2015).  Commitment  is  
an  essential  part  of  reorientation.  If  clients  hope  to  change,  they  must  be  willing  
to  set  tasks  for  themselves  in  everyday  life  and  do  something  specific  about  their  
problems.  In  this  way,  clients  translate  their  new  insights  into  concrete  actions.  
Bitter and Nicoll (2004) emphasize that real change happens between sessions, and 
not in therapy itself. They state that arriving at a strategy for change is an important 
first  step,  and  stress  that  it  takes  courage  and  encouragement  for  clients  to  apply  
what they have learned in therapy to daily living.
This action-oriented phase is a time for solving problems and making decisions. 
The counselor and the client consider possible alternatives and their consequences, 
evaluate how these alternatives will meet the client’s goals, and decide on a specific 
course  of  action.  The  best  alternatives  and  new  possibilities  are  those  generated

by  the  client,  and  the  counselor  must  offer  the  client  a  great  deal  of  support  and  
encouragement during this stage of the process.
Making a Difference Adlerian therapists seek to make a difference in the lives of 
their clients. That difference may be manifested by a change in behavior or attitude 
or perception. Adlerians use many different techniques to promote change, some of 
which have become common interventions in other therapeutic models. Techniques 
that  go  by  the  names  of  immediacy,  advice,  humor,  silence,  paradoxical  intention,  
acting as if, catching oneself, the push-button technique, externalization, reauthoring, 
avoiding the traps, confrontation, use of stories and fables, early recollection analysis, 
lifestyle assessment, encouraging, task setting and commitment, giving homework, 
and  terminating  and  summarizing  have  all  been  used  (Carlson  &  Johnson,  2016;  
Carlson  et  al.,  2006;  Dinkmeyer  &  Sperry,  2000;  Disque  &  Bitter,  1998;  Mozdzierz,  
Peluso,  &  Lisiecki,  2009).  Contemporary  Adlerian  practitioners  are  diverse  in  their  
styles  of  counseling  (Maniacci,  2012;  Watts,  2015),  and  they  can  creatively  employ  
a  wide  range  of  other  techniques,  as  long  as  these  methods  are  philosophically  
consistent with the basic theoretical premises of Adlerian psychology. Adlerians are 
pragmatic when it comes to using techniques that are appropriate for a given client. 
In general, however, Adlerian practitioners focus on motivation modification more 
than behavior change and encourage clients to make holistic changes on the useful 
side of living.
All  therapy  is  a  cooperative  effort,  and  making  a  difference  depends  on  the  
therapist’s ability to win the client’s cooperation. Let’s focus on one technique tra-
ditionally  associated  with  Adlerian  counseling  to  see  what  it  looks  like  in  action.  
Harold  Mosak,  a  highly  respected  therapist,  uses  the  push-button  technique  with  cli-
ents  who  know  they  are  depressed  but  feel  that  the  depression  controls  them  and  
that nothing can be done. The goal of this technique is to help clients become aware 
of their role in contributing to their unpleasant feelings. Typically, clients are asked 
to  re-create  an  unpleasant  memory,  which  is  then  followed  by  recalling  a  pleasant  
memory (Watts, 2015).
 Counselor:  I am sure we can end your depression rather easily. Let’s start 
with what you really need to do with your life [the set up].
 Client:  Wait a minute. If you can get rid of my depression easily, let’s 
do it.
 Counselor:  Well, OK. You will have to close your eyes. I want you to 
think about the worst, most awful thing that has happened 
to you recently. When you have it in mind, I want you to 
raise your right hand. [The client pauses for a few moments and 
then raises his hand.] Now, I would like you to add the feeling 
you feel when you think about this horrible part of your life. 
[Taking the client’s right hand, the counselor presses the index finger 
onto the client’s leg.] We will call this your depression button.
      Now, I want you to think about the best thing that has 
happened to you or could happen to you or you would love 
to have happen to you. Raise your left hand when you know 
what that is.

 Client:  I can’t really think of anything.
 Counselor:  You may have to go back to an earlier time to remember a 
really good time that you would like to have in your life now, 
but I know you can do it. [A minute later the man raises his left 
hand.] Now, add the feeling you have thinking about that 
happy time. [Taking the client’s left hand, the counselor presses the 
index finger onto the client’s other leg.]
      So you have a depression button on your right leg, and 
you can push it and think about everything horrible, awful, 
or worse, and feel depressed. Or you can push the happy 
button on the other leg, think about wonderful things or 
events or people, and feel happy. If you come in next week 
and tell me you have felt depressed, I will simply ask you why 
you decided to push the depression button rather than the 
happy button.
The  push-button  technique  recognizes  that  “control”  is  a  major  theme  in  
depression, and this intervention is designed to help the client regain a sense of con-
trol over the negative feelings that seem overwhelming. An effective way of using this 
technique  may  be  to  give  the  client,  especially  a  child  or  an  adolescent,  an  actual  
push-button to carry in his or her pocket as a physical reminder.
Areas of Application
Adler anticipated the future direction of the helping professions by calling 
upon  therapists  to  become  social  activists  and  by  addressing  the  prevention  and  
remediation of social conditions that were contrary to social interest and resulted 
in  human  problems.  Adler’s  own  experiences  of  discrimination  and  the  influence  
of  social  inequality  are  well  represented  in  his  writings.  Adler’s  pioneering  efforts  
on  prevention  services  in  mental  health  led  him  to  increasingly  advocate  for  the  
role of Individual Psychology in schools and families. Because Individual Psychol-
ogy is based on a growth model, not a medical model, it is applicable to such var-
ied spheres of life as child guidance; parent–child counseling; couples counseling; 
family counseling and therapy; group counseling and therapy; individual counsel-
ing with children, adolescents, and adults; cultural conflicts; correctional and reha-
bilitation counseling; and mental health institutions. Adler’s basic ideas have been 
incorporated into the practices of school psychology, school counseling, the com-
munity  mental  health  movement,  and  parent  education.  Adlerian  principles  have  
been widely applied to substance abuse programs, social problems to combat pov-
erty and crime, problems of the aged, school systems, religion, and business. Adle-
rian ideas also have had widespread international application and acceptance (see 
Fall and Winter 2012 special issues of the Journal of Individual Psychology for interna-
tional perspectives on Individual Psychology).
Application to Family Counseling With its emphasis on the family constellation, 
holism, and the freedom of the therapist to improvise, Adler’s approach contributed 
to the foundation of the family therapy perspective. Adlerians working with families

focus on the family atmosphere, the family constellation, and the interactive goals 
of each member (Bitter, 2014). The family atmosphere is the climate characterizing 
the  relationship  between  the  parents  and  their  attitudes  toward  life,  gender  roles,  
decision  making,  competition,  cooperation,  dealing  with  conflict,  responsibility,  
and  so  forth.  This  atmosphere,  including  the  role  models  the  parents  provide,  
influences the children as they grow up. The therapeutic process seeks to increase 
awareness  of  the  interaction  of  the  individuals  within  the  family  system.  Those  
who  practice  Adlerian  family  therapy  strive  to  understand  the  goals,  beliefs,  and  
behaviors of each family member and the family as an entity in its own right.
Application to Group Counseling Adler and his coworkers used a group approach 
in their child guidance centers in Vienna as early as 1921 (Dreikurs, 1969). Dreikurs 
extended and popularized Adler’s work with groups and used group psychotherapy 
in his private practice for more than 40 years. Although Dreikurs introduced group 
therapy  into  his  psychiatric  practice  as  a  way  to  save  time,  he  quickly  discovered  
some unique characteristics of groups that made them an effective way of helping 
people  change.  Inferiority  feelings  can  be  challenged  and  counteracted  effectively  
in groups, and the mistaken concepts and values that are at the root of social and 
emotional problems can be deeply influenced because the group is a value-forming 
agent (Sonstegard & Bitter, 2004).
The  rationale  for  Adlerian  group  counseling  is  based  on  the  premise  that  our  
problems  are  mainly  of  a  social  nature.  The  group  provides  the  social  context  in  
which  members  can  develop  a  sense  of  belonging,  social  connectedness,  and  com-
munity. Sonstegard and Bitter (2004) write that group participants come to see that 
many  of  their  problems  are  interpersonal  in  nature,  that  their  behavior  has  social  
meaning,  and  that  their  goals  can  best  be  understood  in  the  framework  of  social  
purposes.  Group  counseling  is  particularly  helpful  in  promoting  social  interest.  A  
core therapeutic factor is the role of altruism, which is the process of helping others 
in the group. The process of developing group cohesion parallels social interest (pro-
moting the social welfare, in this case of the group) and community feeling (feeling 
connected and closer to the group itself), which are primary goals of Adlerian ther-
apy. For example, in a men’s group, one of the core goals is often helping discour-
aged  and  isolated  men  feel  useful  to  others  (building  altruism)  and  connected  to  
fellow men. While this group process is building, group members are also building 
their social interest by feeling connected to something bigger than themselves.
The use of early recollections is a unique feature of Adlerian group counseling. 
As  mentioned  earlier,  from  a  series  of  early  memories,  individuals  can  get  a  clear  
sense  of  their  mistaken  notions,  current  attitudes,  social  interests,  and  possible  
future behavior. Through the mutual sharing of these early recollections, members 
develop  a  sense  of  connection  with  one  another,  and  group  cohesion  is  increased.  
The group becomes an agent of change because of the improved interpersonal rela-
tionships among members and the emergence of hope.
Especially  valuable  is  the  way  Adlerian  group  counselors  implement  action  
strategies at each of the group sessions and especially during the reorientation stage 
when  new  decisions  are  made  and  goals  are  modified.  To  challenge  self-limiting  
assumptions, members are encouraged to act as if they were the persons they want 
to be. They are asked to “catch themselves” in the process of repeating old patterns

that have led to ineffective or self-defeating behavior. The members come to appre-
ciate that if they hope to change, they need to set tasks for themselves, apply group 
lessons to daily life, and take steps in finding solutions to their problems. This final 
stage is characterized by group leaders and members working together to challenge 
erroneous beliefs about self, life, and others. During this stage, members are consid-
ering alternative beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes.
Adlerian  group  counseling  can  be  considered  a  brief  approach  to  treatment.  
The core characteristics associated with brief group therapy include rapid establish-
ment of a strong therapeutic alliance, clear problem focus and goal alignment, rapid 
assessment, emphasis on active and directive therapeutic interventions, a focus on 
strengths and abilities of clients, an optimistic view of change, a focus on both the 
present and the future, and an emphasis on tailoring treatment to the unique needs 
of clients in the most time-efficient manner possible (Carlson et al., 2006).
Adlerian brief group therapy is addressed by Sonstegard, Bitter, Pelonis-Peneros, 
and Nicoll (2001). For more on the Adlerian approach to group counseling, refer to 
Theory  and  Practice  of  Group  Counseling  (Corey,  2016,  chap.  7)  and  Sonstegard  and  
Bitter (2004).
Adlerian Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Carlson  and  Englar-Carlson  (2013)  believe  that  Adlerian  theory  is  well  
suited to counseling diverse populations and doing social justice work. They state 
that  Adlerian  therapy  not  only  focuses  acutely  on  multicultural  and  social  justice  
issues  but  is  “alive,  well,  and  poised  to  address  the  concerns  of  a  contemporary  
global society” (p. 94).
Although the Adlerian approach is called Individual Psychology, its focus is on 
the  person  in  a  social  context.  Clients  are  encouraged  to  define  themselves  within  
their  social  environments  and  to  understand  how  those  environments  influence  
their lifestyle and health. Adlerians allow broad concepts of age, ethnicity, lifestyle, 
sexual/affectional  orientations,  and  gender  differences  to  emerge  in  therapy,  and  
these issues are then addressed (Carlson & Englar-Carlson, 2013). The therapeutic 
process is grounded within a client’s culture and worldview rather than attempting 
to fit clients into preconceived models.
In their analysis of the various theoretical approaches to counseling, Arciniega 
and  Newlon  (2003)  state  that  Adlerian  theory  holds  a  great  deal  of  promise  for  
addressing  diversity  issues.  They  note  a  number  of  characteristics  of  Adlerian  the-
ory that are congruent with the values of many racial, cultural, and ethnic groups, 
including the emphasis on understanding the individual in a familial and sociocul-
tural  context;  the  role  of  social  interest  and  contributing  to  others;  and  the  focus  
on belonging and the collective spirit. Cultures that stress the welfare of the social 
group and emphasize the role of the family will find the basic assumptions of Adle-
rian psychology to be consistent with their values.
Adlerian  therapists  tend  to  focus  on  cooperation  and  socially  oriented  val-
ues  as  opposed  to  competitive  and  individualistic  values.  This  makes  the  Adlerian  
approach  well-suited  for  our  increasingly  multicultural  and  pluralistic  society.

Native American clients, for example, tend to value cooperation over competition. 
One  such  client  told  a  story  about  a  group  of  boys  who  were  in  a  race.  When  one  
boy got ahead of the others, he would slow down and allow the others to catch up, 
and  they  all  made  it  to  the  finish  line  at  the  same  time.  Although  the  coach  tried  
to explain that the point of the race was for an individual to finish first, these boys 
were socialized to work together cooperatively as a group. Adlerian therapy is easily 
adaptable to cultural values that emphasize community.
Adlerian  practitioners  are  not  wedded  to  any  particular  set  of  procedures  and  
may  apply  a  range  of  cognitive  and  action-oriented  techniques  to  helping  clients  
explore their practical problems in a cultural context. Adlerians are conscious of the 
value  of  adapting  their  techniques  to  each  client’s  situation,  but  most  of  them  do  
conduct a lifestyle assessment that is heavily focused on the structure and dynam-
ics  within  the  client’s  family.  Because  of  their  cultural  background,  many  clients  
have been conditioned to respect their family heritage and to appreciate the impact 
of  their  family  on  their  own  personal  development.  It  is  essential  that  counselors  
be  sensitive  to  the  conflicting  feelings  and  struggles  of  their  clients.  If  counselors  
demonstrate an understanding of these cultural values, it is likely that these clients 
will be receptive to an exploration of their lifestyle. Such an exploration will involve 
a detailed discussion of their own place within their family.
It should be noted that Adlerians investigate culture in much the same way that 
they approach birth order and family atmosphere. Culture is a vantage point from 
which life is experienced and interpreted; it is also a background of values, history, 
convictions, beliefs, customs, and expectations that must be addressed by the indi-
vidual. Culture provides a way of grasping the subjective and experiential perspec-
tive of an individual. Although culture influences each person, it is expressed within 
each individual differently, according to the perception, evaluation, and interpreta-
tion of culture that the person holds. Adlerians find in different cultures opportuni-
ties for viewing the self, others, and the world in multidimensional ways.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
As is true of most Western models, the Adlerian approach tends to focus on the self 
as  the  locus  of  change  and  responsibility.  Because  other  cultures  may  have  differ-
ent conceptions, this primary emphasis on changing the autonomous self may be 
problematic  for  many  clients.  Assumptions  about  the  Western  nuclear  family  are  
built into the Adlerian concepts of birth order and family constellation. For people 
brought up in extended family contexts, some of these ideas may be less relevant or 
at least may need to be reconfigured.
Adlerian  theory  has  some  potential  drawbacks  for  clients  from  those  cultures  
who  are  not  interested  in  exploring  past  childhood  experiences,  early  memories,  
family  experiences,  and  dreams.  This  approach  also  has  limited  effectiveness  with  
clients  who  do  not  understand  the  purpose  of  exploring  the  details  of  a  lifestyle  
analysis  when  dealing  with  life’s  current  problems  (Arciniega  &  Newlon,  2003).  In  
addition, the culture of some clients may contribute to their viewing the counselor 
as the “expert” and expecting that the counselor will provide them with solutions to 
their problems. For these clients, the role of the Adlerian therapist may pose prob-
lems because Adlerian therapists are not experts in solving other people’s problems.

Instead,  they  view  it  as  their  function  to  collaboratively  teach  people  alternative  
methods of coping with life concerns.
Many  clients  who  have  pressing  problems  are  likely  to  be  hesitant  to  discuss  
areas  of  their  lives  that  they  may  not  see  as  connected  to  the  struggles  that  bring  
them into therapy. Individuals may believe that it is inappropriate to reveal family 
information.  On  this  point  Carlson  and  Carlson  (2000)  suggest  that  a  therapist’s  
sensitivity and understanding of a client’s culturally constructed beliefs about dis-
closing  family  information  are  critical.  If  the  therapist  is  able  to  demonstrate  an  
understanding of a client’s cultural values, it is likely that this person will be more 
open to the assessment and treatment process.
T
he  basic  aims  of  an  Adlerian  therapist  working  
with Stan are fourfold and correspond to the four 
stages of counseling: (1) establishing and maintaining 
a  good  working  relationship  with  Stan,  (2)  exploring  
Stan’s  dynamics,  (3)  encouraging  Stan  to  develop  in-
sight and understanding, and (4) helping Stan see new 
alternatives and make new choices.
To  develop  mutual  trust  and  respect,  I  pay  close  
attention  to  Stan’s  subjective  experience  and  attempt  
to  get  a  sense  of  how  he  has  reacted  to  the  turning  
points  in  his  life.  During  the  initial  session,  Stan  re-
acts  to  me  as  the  expert  who  has  the  answers.  He  is  
convinced that when he makes decisions he generally 
ends up regretting the results. Stan approaches me out 
of desperation. Because I view counseling as a relation-
ship between equals, I initially focus on his feeling of 
being  unequal  to  most  other  people.  A  good  place  to  
begin is exploring his feelings of inferiority, which he 
says he feels in most situations. The goals of counsel-
ing  are  developed  mutually,  and  I  avoid  deciding  for  
Stan what his goals should be. I also resist giving Stan 
the simple formula he is requesting.
I  prepare  a  lifestyle  assessment  based  on  a  ques-
tionnaire  that  taps  information  about  Stan’s  early  
years, especially his experiences in his family. (See the 
Student  Manual  for  Theory  and  Practice  of  Counseling  and  
Psychotherapy [Corey, 2017] for a complete description of 
this lifestyle assessment form as it is applied to Stan.) 
This assessment includes a determination of whether 
he poses a danger to himself because Stan did mention 
suicidal ideation. During the assessment phase, which 
might take a few sessions, I explore with Stan his social 
relationships,  his  relationships  with  members  of  his  
family, his work responsibilities, his role as a man, and 
his feelings about himself. I place considerable empha-
sis  on  Stan’s  goals  in  life  and  his  priorities.  I  do  not  
pay a great deal of attention to his past, except to show 
him the consistency between his past and present as he 
moves toward the future.
As an Adlerian counselor, I place value on explor-
ing early recollections as a source of understanding his 
goals, motivations, and values. I ask Stan to report his 
earliest memories.
Stan: I was about 6, I went to school, and I was scared 
of the other kids and the teacher. When I came 
home, I cried and told my mother I didn’t want 
to go back to school. She yelled at me and called 
me a baby. After that I felt horrible and even more 
scared.
Another of Stan’s early recollections was at age 8:
Stan:
 My family was visiting my grandparents. I was 
playing outside, and some neighborhood kid hit 
me for no reason. We started fighting, and my 
mother came out and scolded me for being such 
a rough kid. She wouldn’t believe me when I told 
her he started the fight. I felt angry and hurt that 
she didn’t believe me.
Based on these early recollections, I suggest that Stan 
sees  life  as  frightening  and  unpredictably  hostile  and  
that he feels he cannot count on women; they are likely 
to be harsh, unbelieving, and uncaring.
Having   gathered   the   data   based   on   the   life-
style  assessment  about  his  family  constellation  and  
his  early  recollections,  I  assist  Stan  in  the  process  of

See  the DVD  for  Theory  and  Practice  of  Counseling  
and  Psychotherapy:  The  Case  of  Stan  and  Lecturettes 
(Session  3  on  Adlerian  therapy)  for  a  demon-
stration  of  my  approach  to  counseling  Stan  by  
focusing on his early recollections.
summarizing   and   interpreting   this   information.   I   
give   particular   attention   to   identifying   basic   mis-
takes, which are faulty conclusions about life and self-
defeating perceptions. Here are some of the mistaken 
conclusions Stan has reached:
“I must not get close to people, because they will 
surely hurt me.”
“Because my own parents didn’t want me and 
didn’t love me, I’ll never be desired or loved by 
anybody.”
“If only I could become perfect, maybe people 
would acknowledge and accept me.”
“Being a man means not showing emotions.”
The information I summarize and interpret leads 
to insight and increased self-understanding on Stan’s 
part. He gains increased awareness of his need to con-
trol  his  world  so  that  he  can  keep  painful  feelings  in  
check. He sees more clearly some of the ways he tries to 
gain control over his pain: through the use of alcohol, 
avoiding interpersonal situations that are threatening, 
and  being  unwilling  to  count  on  others  for  psycho-
logical  support.  Through  continued  emphasis  on  his  
beliefs,  goals,  and  intentions,  Stan  comes  to  see  how  
his private logic is inaccurate. In his case, a syllogism 
for his style of life can be explained in this way: (1) “I 
am unloved, insignificant, and do not count”; (2) “The 
world  is  a  threatening  place  to  be,  and  life  is  unfair”;  
(3) “Therefore, I must find ways to protect myself and 
be  safe.”  During  this  phase  of  the  process,  I  make  in-
terpretations centering on his lifestyle, his current di-
rection,  his  goals  and  purposes,  and  how  his  private  
logic  works.  Of  course,  Stan  is  expected  to  carry  out  
homework assignments that assist him in translating 
his insights into new behavior. In this way he is an ac-
tive participant in his therapy.
In  the  reorientation  phase  of  therapy,  Stan  and  
I  work  together  to  consider  alternative  attitudes,  
beliefs,  and  actions.  By  now  Stan  sees  that  he  does  
not have to be locked into past patterns, feels encour-
aged,  and  realizes  that  he  has  the  power  to  change  
his  life.  He  accepts  that  he  will  not  change  merely  
by  gaining  insights  and  knows  that  he  will  have  to  
make use of these insights by carrying out an action-
oriented  plan.  Stan  begins  to  feel  that  he  can  create  
a  new  life  for  himself  and  not  remain  the  victim  of  
circumstances.
Questions for Reflection
What are some ways you would attempt to estab-
lish a relationship with Stan based on trust and 
mutual respect? Can you imagine any difficulties 
in developing this relationship with him?
What aspects of Stan’s lifestyle particularly inter-
est you? In counseling him, how would these be 
explored?
The Adlerian therapist identified four of Stan’s 
mistaken conclusions. Can you identify with any 
of these basic mistakes? If so, do you think this 
would help or hinder your therapeutic effective-
ness with him?
How might Stan’s cultural identity and context 
be assessed, and what might be the relationship to 
his presenting concerns?
How might you assist Stan in discovering his 
social interest and going beyond a preoccupation 
with his own problems?
What strengths and resources in Stan might you 
draw on to support his determination and com-
mitment to change?
  
Adlerian Therapy Applied to the Case of Gwen*

A
s the eldest child, Gwen learned early on that she 
was  responsible  not  only  for  herself  but  for  all  
those in need around her as well. She often sacrificed 
her  own  desires  in  an  effort  to  please  of  others.  She  
knows how to stand up for herself, but too often takes 
on  the  role  of  helper  and  loses  her  sense  of  personal  
meaning and identity.
* Dr. Kellie Kirksey writes about her ways of thinking and practicing from an Adlerian perspective and applying this model to Gwen.

Adlerian Therapy Applied to the Case of Gwen*
Gwen: I have played by everyone’s rules for so long, 
and now I am just tired. I just can’t seem to win.
Therapist: If I were facing everything you are facing, 
I too would be tired and sad . . . and sometimes 
irritated.
I want to normalize Gwen’s experience because I know 
all too well that being an African American woman jug-
gling  multiple  roles  carries  with  it  additional  stresses  
and burdens.
Therapist: Is it safe to say that your life feels out of 
control?
Gwen: Yes. I can’t remember the last time I felt I was 
really in the driver’s seat.
Therapist: So, let’s see. You take care of your spouse, 
your mother, and check in on your siblings—
which, by the way, you have been doing since you 
were a child. Even though your children are gone, 
you still listen to their needs on a regular basis 
and help out in any way that you can. You seldom 
if ever see your friends (no time), and you cannot 
seem to concentrate on your work enough to feel 
productive. Did I understand you correctly?
Gwen: Yes. You got it all.
Therapist: I am not even sure I am close to getting it 
all, because all of that is enough to overload anyone.
Gwen: Yes, I am totally overloaded. I have to handle 
all of this, get things done, and get life back to 
normal. But I just can’t get focused.
Therapist: Yes. There is so much. You get distracted; 
you start running without knowing where you are 
going; you worry; and the cycle continues.
Gwen:
 I just have so many problems.
Therapist: What would you be doing with your life if 
you did not have all of these problems in your life? 
How would your life be different? [Asking “The 
Question.”]
Gwen: That’s just it: I don’t know anymore. Well, I 
wouldn’t feel so depressed anymore. I would hope 
for a better life with my husband and friends, but 
I don’t even know if that is possible.
Gwen  comes  to  the  next  session  looking  some-
what  more  relaxed  than  at  our  first  session.  I  ask  her  
what accounts for this, and she says that really every-
thing is about the same, but she felt understood at the 
last session, so she has some hope. I thank her for tell-
ing  me  and  congratulate  her  on  the  courage  she  has  
shown in coming to therapy.
Therapist: Gwen, I would like to get to know you 
a little better, to have a sense of what you have 
learned from life. Would it be OK if I ask you 
about some important parts of your life so far?
Gwen: Yes, of course.
During this session, I begin to ask Gwen about the 
story  of  her  life,  using  the  tools  Adlerians  include  in  
a  lifestyle  assessment.  I  ask  about  her  family  constel-
lation, including descriptions of and the relationship 
between  her  parents.  I  ask  which  of  her  siblings  was  
most different from her and in what way? Which one 
was like her and in what way? And what was she like as 
a  child?  In  each  of  these  descriptions,  Gwen  tells  me  
about  the  early  meaning  she  attached  to  her  family  
life.  During  this  discussion  she  tells  me  about  being  
molested  as  a  child  by  an  older  cousin  and  her  deter-
mination to protect her siblings from a similar fate.
In the next session, Gwen tells me about her devel-
opmental history, addressing each one of Adler’s three 
tasks of life. She has always been a person who had just 
a few close friends, and she tends to take charge. “I guess 
some of my friends think I am a bit bossy. I know my sis-
ter does for sure, and she is still my best friend.” Gwen 
has always worked, first in the home, and then increas-
ingly  out  in  the  world.  She  had  her  first  real  job  when  
she was 14, having lied about her age, so she could work 
at a neighborhood restaurant. She has always taken care 
of  other  people,  even  while  going  to  college—and  now,  
even while she has heavy demands at her work. Her hus-
band is a community activist. Ron is the only man with 
whom she has ever been in love. She feels they are grow-
ing apart, but they handle it by both staying busy. It is 
easy to hear in her stories how responsible for others she 
feels, how exhausted she must be, and how much of her-
self gets lost in the daily struggles.
Therapist:
 The struggles you mention are hard 
enough by themselves. But you also mentioned 
dealing with experiences of racism and sexism. 
Can you tell me about some of the particular 
challenges you have had to face as an African 
American woman?

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Adler was far ahead of his time, and most contemporary therapies have incorpo-
rated  at  least  some  of  his  ideas.  Individual  Psychology  assumes  that  people  are  
motivated  by  social  factors;  are  responsible  for  their  own  thoughts,  feelings,  and  
actions;  are  the  creators  of  their  own  lives,  as  opposed  to  being  helpless  victims;  
and are impelled by purposes and goals, looking more toward the future than back 
to the past.
The  basic  goal  of  the  Adlerian  approach  is  to  help  clients  identify  and  change  
their mistaken beliefs about, self, others, and life and thus to participate more fully 
in a social world. Clients are not viewed as psychologically sick, but as discouraged. 
The therapeutic process helps individuals become aware of their patterns and make 
some basic changes in their style of living, which lead to changes in the way they feel 
and behave. The role of the family in the development of the individual is empha-
sized.  Therapy  is  a  cooperative  venture  that  challenges  clients  to  translate  their  
insights into action in the real world. Contemporary Adlerian theory is an integra-
tive approach, combining cognitive, constructivist, existential, psychodynamic, rela-
tional, and systems perspectives. Some of these common characteristics include an 
I,  too,  am  an  African  American  woman,  but  I  cannot  
assume that my own experiences are similar to hers. I 
have  to  hear  what  meaning  she  personally  associates  
with race and gender, which are additional tasks of life 
she must address every day of her existence. I want to 
know what her biggest challenge is as a member of her 
culture  as  well  as  her  greatest  strength  and  points  of  
cultural pride.
Toward the end of the session, I ask Gwen to pre-
pare  a  list  of  early  recollections  for  our  next  session.  
I  ask  her  to  remember  six  or  more  stories  that  hap-
pened before she was 8 years old. I want her to think of 
the event like a moving picture and stop it at a single 
frame:  What  is  happening  in  that  frame,  and  what  is  
she feeling? What is her reaction to what happened? If 
this were a newspaper story, what would be the head-
line?  These  memories  will  most  likely  confirm  what  I  
am  already  learning  about  Gwen,  and  they  will  help  
me identify the convictions and beliefs, some of which 
may be faulty, that guide her life.
Lifestyle  assessment  is  a  way  of  investigating  the  
client’s unique approach to the life tasks of love, friend-
ship, and work. It is filled with meaning and identity 
and convictions and beliefs. It also contains the traits 
that  make  up  the  individual’s  internal  resources,  the  
motivations  for  both  feelings  and  behaviors,  and  the  
foundation  for  where  life  might  develop  from  here.  
The  golden  rule  of  Individual  Psychology  is  that  “ev-
erything can be different.” What difference does Gwen 
want to make in her life now?
Questions for Reflection
What are your thoughts about asking Gwen to 
identify some of her early recollections? Is this 
kind of ancient history really important in how an 
individual develops a lifestyle? Why do we remem-
ber these things?
Gwen wants more suggestions from her therapist. 
If you were her therapist, how would you intervene 
with her when she wants more direction from you?
Encouragement is a foundational technique of 
Adlerian therapy. Can you identify any encourag-
ing behaviors by the therapist? What value do you 
place on encouragement? What is the difference 
between encouragement and praise?
How interested would you be in getting informa-
tion from Gwen about issues of race and culture?
What additional Adlerian technique would you 
use if you were counseling Gwen? What would 
your aim be in making this intervention?

emphasis on establishing a respectful client–therapist relationship, an emphasis on 
clients’ strengths and resources, and an optimistic and future orientation.
Contributions of the Adlerian Approach
A strength of the Adlerian approach is its flexibility and its integrative nature. 
Adlerian therapists are resourceful and flexible in drawing on many methods, which 
can be applied to a diverse range of clients in a variety of settings and formats. They 
tend to be theoretically consistent and technically eclectic (Watts, 2015). Therapists 
are mainly concerned with doing what is in the best interests of clients rather than 
squeezing clients into one theoretical framework (Carlson et al., 2006).
Another contribution of the Adlerian approach is that it is suited to brief, time-
limited therapy. Adler was a proponent of time-limited therapy, and the techniques 
used by many contemporary brief therapeutic approaches are very similar to inter-
ventions  created  by  or  commonly  used  by  Adlerian  practitioners  (Carlson  et  al.,  
2006).  Adlerian  therapy  and  contemporary  brief  therapy  have  in  common  a  num-
ber of characteristics, including quickly establishing a strong therapeutic alliance, a 
clear problem focus and goal alignment, rapid assessment and application to treat-
ment, an emphasis on active and directive intervention, a psychoeducational focus, 
a present and future orientation, a focus on clients’ strengths and abilities and an 
optimistic expectation of change, and a time sensitivity that tailors treatment to the 
unique  needs  of  the  client  (Carlson  et  al.,  2006;  Hoyt,  2015).  According  to  Mosak  
and  Di  Pietro  (2006),  early  recollections  are  a  significant  assessment  intervention  
in brief therapy. They claim that early recollections are often useful in minimizing 
the number of therapy sessions. This procedure takes little time to administer and 
interpret and provides a direction for therapists to pursue.
Bitter  and  Nicoll  (2000)  identify  five  characteristics  that  form  the  basis  for  an  
integrative  framework  in  brief  therapy:  time  limitation,  focus,  counselor  directive-
ness,  symptoms  as  solutions,  and  the  assignment  of  behavioral  tasks.  Bringing  a  
time-limitation  process  to  therapy  conveys  to  clients  the  expectation  that  change  
will occur in a short period of time. When the number of sessions is specified, both 
client and therapist are motivated to stay focused on desired outcomes and to work 
as  efficiently  as  possible.  Because  there  is  no  assurance  that  a  future  session  will  
occur, brief therapists tend to ask themselves this question: “If I had only one ses-
sion to be useful in this person’s life, what would I want to accomplish?” (p. 38).
It is difficult to overestimate the contributions of Adler to contemporary thera-
peutic practice. In many ways, I believe Adler’s influence on current practice is greater 
than  that  of  Freud.  Many  of  Adler’s  ideas  were  revolutionary  and  far  ahead  of  his  
time. His influence went beyond counseling individuals, extending into the commu-
nity mental health movement (Ansbacher, 1974). Abraham Maslow, Viktor Frankl, 
Rollo May, Paul Watzlawick, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, Aaron T. Beck, and Albert 
Ellis have all acknowledged their debt to Adler. Both Frankl and May see him as a 
forerunner of the existential movement because of his position that human beings 
are free to choose and are entirely responsible for what they make of themselves. This 
view also makes him a forerunner of the subjective approach to psychology, which 
focuses  on  the  internal  determinants  of  behavior:  values,  beliefs,  attitudes,  goals,  
interests, personal meanings, subjective perceptions of reality, and strivings toward

self-realization.  Bitter  (2008;  Bitter,  Robertson,  Healey,  &  Cole,  2009)  has  drawn  
attention to the link between Adlerian thinking and feminist therapy approaches.
One of Adler’s most important contributions was his influence on other therapy 
systems.  Many  of  his  basic  ideas  have  found  their  way  into  most  of  the  other  psy-
chological  schools,  a  few  of  which  include  existential  therapy,  cognitive  behavior  
therapy,  rational  emotive  behavior  therapy,  reality  therapy,  solution-focused  brief  
therapy, feminist therapy, and family therapy. Adlerian psychology is a phenomeno-
logical,  holistic,  optimistic,  and  socially  embedded  theory  based  on  basic  assump-
tions that have been woven into various theories of counseling (Carlson & Johnson, 
2016;  Maniacci  et  al.,  2014).  In  many  respects,  Adler  seems  to  have  paved  the  way  
for current developments in both the cognitive and constructivist therapies (Watts, 
2012,  2015).  Adlerians’  basic  premise  is  that  if  clients  can  change  their  thinking,  
then they can change their feelings and behavior. A study of contemporary counsel-
ing theories reveals that many of Adler’s notions have reappeared in these modern 
approaches with different nomenclature, and often without giving Adler the credit 
that  is  due  to  him  (Watts,  2015).  One  example  of  this  is  found  in  the  emergence  
of  the  positive  psychology  movement,  which  calls  for  an  increased  study  of  hope,  
courage, contentment, happiness, well-being, perseverance, resilience, tolerance, and 
personal  resources.  Adler  clearly  addressed  major  themes  associated  with  positive  
psychology  long  before  this  approach  appeared  on  the  therapeutic  scene  (Watts,  
2012). It is clear that there are significant linkages between Adlerian theory and most 
of the present-day theories, especially those that view the person as purposive, self-
determining, and striving for growth. Carlson and Englar-Carlson (2013) assert that 
Adlerians face the challenge of continuing to develop their approach so that it meets 
the needs of contemporary global society: “Whereas Adlerian ideas are alive in other 
theoretical approaches, there is a question about whether Adlerian theory as a stand-
alone approach is viable in the long term” (p. 124). With so many Adlerian concepts 
co-opted by other models, these authors believe that for the Adlerian model to sur-
vive and thrive it will be necessary to find ways to strive for significance.
Limitations and Criticisms of the Adlerian Approach
Adler  had  to  choose  between  devoting  his  time  to  formalizing  his  theory  
and  teaching  others  the  basic  concepts  of  Individual  Psychology.  He  placed  prac-
ticing  therapy  and  teaching  before  organizing  and  presenting  a  well-defined  and  
systematic theory. Many of Adler’s ideas are vague and general, which makes it dif-
ficult to conduct research on some concepts (Carlson & Johnson, 2016). His writ-
ten presentations are often difficult to follow, and many of them are transcripts of 
lectures he gave. Adler’s global reach was unprecedented, but he did not attend to 
the way his work was translated. Although he was brilliant in many ways, he was not 
scholarly (Maniacci, 2012).
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What are some of your earliest memories? Identify one specific early 
memory and reflect on the significance this early recollection has for 
you. What value do you see in the Adlerian technique of having indi-
viduals recall their earliest memories?

2. Adlerians contend that each of us has a unique lifestyle, or personality, 
that starts to develop in early childhood to compensate for and over-
come some perceived inferiority. How does this key concept apply to 
you? In what ways have you felt inferior in the past, and how have you 
dealt with it? Do you see any potential connection between your strug-
gle with basic inferiority and your accomplishments?
3.
 From an Adlerian perspective, individuals are best understood by 
looking at their future strivings. How are your goals influencing what 
you are doing now? How do you think your past has influenced your 
future goals? In what ways can you apply this purposive, goal-oriented 
approach in your work as a therapist?
4.
 Adlerians emphasize the family constellation. Reflect on what it was 
like for you to grow up in your family. How would you characterize 
your relationship with each of your siblings? What did you learn about 
yourself and others through your early family experiences?
5.
 Social interest is a central concept in the Adlerian approach. What value 
do you place on social interest in your own life? In what ways do you 
think you could assist your clients in developing their social interest?

130            CHAPTER SIX 
VIKTOR FRANKL (1905–1997) was born 
and educated in Vienna. He founded the 
Youth Advisement Centers there in 1928 
and directed them until 1938. From 1942 
to 1945 Frankl was a prisoner in the Nazi 
concentration  camps  at  Auschwitz  and  
Dachau, where his parents, brother, wife, 
and children died. He vividly remembered 
his  horrible  experiences  in  these  camps,  
but he did not allow them to dampen his 
love and enthusiasm for life. He traveled 
all  around  the  world,  giving  lectures  in  
Europe,  Latin  America,  Southeast  Asia,  
and the United States.
Frankl  received  his  MD  in  1930  and  his  PhD  
in  philosophy  in  1949,  both  from  the  University  of  
Vienna.  He  became  an  associate  professor  at  the  
University  of  Vienna  and  later  was  a  distinguished  
speaker at the United States International University 
in San Diego. He was a visiting professor at Harvard, 
Stanford,    and    Southern    Methodist    universities.    
Frankl’s  works  have  been  translated  into  more  than  
20 languages, and his ideas continue to have a major 
impact on the development of existential therapy. His 
compelling book Man’s Search for Meaning (1963) has 
been a best-seller around the world.
Although Frankl had begun to develop an existen-
tial approach to clinical practice before his grim years in 
the Nazi death camps, his experiences there confirmed 
his views. Frankl (1963) observed and personally expe-
rienced the truths expressed by existential philosophers 
and  writers  who  hold  that  we  have  choices  in  every  
situation. Even in terrible circumstances, he believed, 
we  could  preserve  a  vestige  of  spiritual  freedom  and  
independence of mind. He learned experientially that 
everything  could  be  taken  from  a  person  except  one  
thing:  “the  last  of  human  freedoms—to  choose  one’s  
attitude  in  any  given  set  of  circumstances,  to  choose  
one’s  own  way”  (p.  104).  Frankl  believed  that  the  
essence of being human lies in searching for meaning 
and  purpose.  We  can  discover  this  meaning  through  
our  actions  and  deeds,  by  experiencing  a  value  (such  
as love or achievements), and by suffering.
Frankl   was   deeply   influenced   by   
Freud,  but  he  disagreed  with  the  rigid-
ity of Freud’s psychoanalytic system and 
became a student of Alfred Adler. React-
ing against most of Freud’s deterministic 
notions,  Frankl  developed  his  own  the-
ory and practice of psychotherapy, which 
emphasized   the   concepts   of   freedom,   
responsibility,  meaning,  and  the  search  
for  values.  He  established  his  interna-
tional reputation as the founder of what 
has  been  called  “The  Third  School  of  
Viennese  Psychoanalysis,”  the  other  two  
being  Sigmund  Freud’s  psychoanalysis  and  Alfred  
Adler’s Individual Psychology.
Frankl was a central figure in developing existen-
tial therapy in Europe and in bringing it to the United 
States.  He  was  fond  of  quoting  Nietzsche:  “He  who  
has  a  why  to  live  for  can  bear  with  almost  any  how” 
(as  cited  in  Frankl,  1963,  pp.  121,  164).  Frankl  con-
tended  that  those  words  could  be  the  motto  for  all  
psychotherapeutic  practice.  Another  quotation  from  
Nietzsche  seems  to  capture  the  essence  of  Frankl’s  
own  experience  and  writings:  “That  which  does  not  
kill me, makes me stronger” (as cited in Frankl, 1963, 
p. 130).
Frankl   developed   logotherapy,   which   means   
“therapy  through  meaning.”  Frankl’s  philosophical  
model sheds light on what it means to be fully alive. 
The  central  themes  running  through  his  works  are  
life  has  meaning,  under  all  circumstances;  the  central  
motivation  for  living  is  the  will  to  meaning;  we  have  
the freedom  to  find  meaning  in  all  that  we  think;  and  
we must integrate body, mind, and spirit to be fully alive. 
Frankl’s  writings  reflect  the  theme  that  the  modern  
person has the means to live, but often has no mean-
ing to live for.
I have selected Frankl as one of the key figures of 
the existential approach because of the dramatic way 
in  which  his  theories  were  tested  by  the  tragedies  of  
his life. His life was an illustration of his theory, for he 
lived what his theory espouses.

EXISTEnTIAl THERAPy         131 
ROLLO  MAY  (1909–1994)  first  lived  in  
Ohio  and  then  moved  to  Michigan  as  a  
young  child  along  with  his  five  brothers  
and  a  sister.  He  remembered  his  home  
life  as  being  unhappy,  a  situation  that  
contributed to his interest in psychology 
and counseling. In his personal life, May 
struggled  with  his  own  existential  con-
cerns and the failure of two marriages.
May  graduated  from  Oberlin  Col-
lege  in  1930  and  then  went  to  Greece  as  
a teacher. During his summers in Greece 
he traveled to Vienna to study with Alfred 
Adler.   After   receiving   a   degree   in   theology   from   
Union  Theological  Seminary,  May  decided  that  the  
best  way  to  reach  out  and  help  people  was  through  
psychology  instead  of  theology.  He  completed  his  
doctorate in clinical psychology at Columbia Univer-
sity and started a private practice in New York; he also 
became a supervisory training analyst for the William 
Alanson Institute.
While  May  was  pursuing  his  doctoral  program,  
he  came  down  with  tuberculosis,  which  resulted  in  
a  two-year  stay  in  a  sanitarium.  During  his  recov-
ery  period,  May  spent  much  time  learning  firsthand  
about the nature of anxiety. He also spent time read-
ing,  and  he  studied  the  works  of  Søren  Kierkegaard,  
which  was  the  catalyst  for  May  recognizing  the  exis-
tential  dimensions  of  anxiety  and  resulted  in  him  
writing The  Meaning  of  Anxiety  (1950).  His  popular  
book Love  and  Will  (1969)  reflects  his  own  personal  
struggles  with  love  and  intimate  relationships  and  
mirrors  Western  society’s  questioning  of  its  values  
pertaining to sex and marriage.
The  greatest  personal  influence  on  
Rollo May was the existential theologian  
Paul  Tillich  (author  of  The  Courage  to  Be, 
1952), who became his mentor and a per-
sonal  friend.  The  two  spent  much  time  
together   discussing   philosophical,   reli-
gious, and psychological topics. May was 
deeply  influenced  by  the  existential  phi-
losophers,  by  the  concepts  of  Freudian  
psychology, and by many aspects of Alfred 
Adler’s  Individual  Psychology.  Most  of  
May’s writings reflect a concern with the 
nature of human experience, such as rec-
ognizing and dealing with power, accepting freedom 
and responsibility, and discovering one’s identity. He 
draws from his rich knowledge based on the classics 
and his existential perspective.
May’s writings have had a significant impact on 
existentially  oriented  practitioners,  and  his  writings  
helped translate key existential concepts into psycho-
therapeutic practice in the United States and Europe. 
May   believed   psychotherapy   should   be   aimed   at   
helping  people  discover  the  meaning  of  their  lives  
and should be concerned with the problems of being 
rather than with problem solving. It takes courage to 
“be,” and our choices determine the kind of person we 
become. Questions of being include learning to deal 
with issues such as sex and intimacy, growing old, fac-
ing death, and taking action in the world. According 
to May, the real challenge is for people to be able to 
live  in  a  world  where  they  are  alone  and  where  they  
will  eventually  have  to  face  death.  It  is  the  task  of  
therapists to help individuals find ways to contribute 
to the betterment of the society in which they live.
IRVIN   YALOM   (b.   1931)   was   born   of   
parents   who   immigrated   from   Russia   
shortly  after  World  War  I.  During  his  
early childhood, Yalom lived in the inner 
city of Washington, D.C., in a poor neigh-
borhood. Life on the streets was perilous, 
and  Yalom  took  refuge  indoors  reading  
novels and other works. Twice a week he 
made  the  hazardous  bicycle  trek  to  the  
library  to  stock  up  on  reading  supplies.  
He  found  an  alternative  and  satisfying  
world  in  reading  fiction,  which  was  a  
source of inspiration and wisdom to him. 
Early in his life he decided that writing a 
novel  was  the  very  finest  thing  a  person  
could  do,  and  subsequently  he  has  writ-
ten several teaching novels.
Irvin   Yalom   is   Professor   Emeritus   
of   Psychiatry   at   the   Stanford   Univer-
sity  School  of  Medicine.  A  psychiatrist  
and  author,  Yalom  has  been  a  major  fig-
ure  in  the  field  of  group  psychotherapy  
since  publication  in  1970  of  his  influen-
tial  book  The  Theory  and  Practice  of  Group

Introduction
Existential therapy is more a way of thinking, or an attitude about psycho- 
LO1
therapy,  than  a  particular  style  of  practicing  psychotherapy.  It  is  neither  an  inde-
pendent or separate school of therapy, nor is it a clearly defined model with specific 
techniques. Existential therapy can best be described as a philosophical approach that 
influences a counselor’s therapeutic practice.
Existential  psychotherapy  is  an  attitude  toward  human  suffering  and  has  no  
manual.  It  asks  deep  questions  about  the  nature  of  the  human  being  and  the  
nature  of  anxiety,  despair,  grief,  loneliness,  isolation,  and  anomie.  It  also  deals  
centrally with the questions of meaning, creativity, and love. (Yalom & Josselson,  
2014, p. 265)
Existential  therapy  focuses  on  exploring  themes  such  as  mortality,  meaning,  
freedom, responsibility, anxiety, and aloneness as these relate to a person’s current 
struggle.  The  goal  of  existential  therapy  is  to  assist  clients  in  their  exploration  of  
the existential “givens of life,” how these are sometimes ignored or denied, and how 
addressing  them  can  ultimately  lead  to  a  deeper,  more  reflective  and  meaningful  
existence. Clients are invited to reflect on life, to recognize their range of alternatives, 
and to decide among them. Existential therapy is grounded on the assumption that 
we are free and therefore responsible for our choices and actions. We are the authors 
Psychotherapy  (1970/2005b),  which  has  been  trans-
lated  into  12  languages  and  is  currently  in  its  fifth  
edition. His pioneering work, Existential Psychotherapy, 
written in 1980, is a classic and authoritative textbook 
on  existential  therapy.  A  contemporary  existential  
therapist  in  the  United  States,  Yalom  acknowledges  
the  contributions  of  both  European  and  American  
psychologists  and  psychiatrists  to  the  development  
of  existential  thinking  and  practice.  Drawing  on  his  
clinical  experience  and  on  empirical  research,  phi-
losophy,  and  literature,  Yalom  developed  an  existen-
tial  approach  to  psychotherapy  that  addresses  four  
“givens  of  existence,”  or  ultimate  human  concerns:  
freedom   and   responsibility,   existential   isolation,   
meaninglessness, and death. These existential themes 
deal with the client’s existence, or being-in-the-world. 
Yalom believes the vast majority of experienced ther-
apists,   regardless   of   their   theoretical   orientation,   
address these core existential themes. How we address 
these existential themes greatly influences the design 
and quality of our lives.
Psychotherapy has been endlessly intriguing for 
Yalom,  who  has  approached  all  of  his  patients  with  
a sense of wonderment at the stories they reveal. He 
believes  that  a  different  therapy  must  be  designed  
for  each  client  because  each  has  a  unique  story.  He  
advocates  using  the  here  and  now  of  the  therapeu-
tic  relationship  to  explore  the  client’s  interpersonal  
world,  and  believes  the  therapist  must  be  transpar-
ent, especially regarding his or her experience of the 
client.  His  basic  philosophy  is  existential  and  inter-
personal,  which  he  applies  to  both  individual  and  
group therapy.
Irvin  Yalom  has  authored  many  stories  and  
novels  related  to  psychotherapy,  including  Love’s 
Executioner (1987), When Nietzsche Wept (1992), Lying 
on  the  Couch  (1997),  Momma  and  the  Meaning  of  Life 
(2000), and The Schopenhauer Cure (2005a). His 2008 
nonfiction  book,  Staring  at  the  Sun:  Overcoming  the  
Terror  of  Death,  is  a  treatise  on  the  role  of  death  
anxiety  in  psychotherapy,  illustrating  how  death  
and  the  meaning  of  life  are  foundational  themes  
associated with in-depth therapeutic work. Yalom’s 
works,  translated  into  more  than  20  languages,  
have  been  widely  read  by  therapists  and  laypeople  
alike.

of our lives, and we design the pathways we follow. This chapter addresses some of 
the existential concepts and themes that have significant implications for the exis-
tentially oriented practitioner.
A basic existential premise is that we are not victims of circumstance because, 
to  a  large  extent,  we  are  what  we  choose  to  be.  Once  clients  begin  the  process  of  
recognizing  the  ways  in  which  they  have  passively  accepted  circumstances  and  
surrendered control, they can start down a path of consciously shaping their own 
lives. The first step in the therapeutic journey is for clients to accept responsibility. 
As  Yalom  (2003)  puts  it,  “Once  individuals  recognize  their  role  in  creating  their  
own life predicament, they also realize that they, and only they, have the power to 
change  that  situation”  (p.  141).  The  aim  of  existential  therapy  is  to  invite  clients  
to  explore  their  values  and  beliefs  and  take  action  that  grows  out  of  this  honest  
appraisal  of  their  life’s  purpose.  The  therapist’s  basic  task  is  to  encourage  clients  
to consider what they are most serious about so they can pursue a direction in life  
(Deurzen, 2012).

Historical Background in Philosophy and Existentialism
Many streams of thought contributed to the existential therapy movement 
in the 1940s and 1950s, and it arose spontaneously in different parts of Europe 
and  among  different  schools  of  psychology  and  psychiatry.  Many  Europeans  
found  that  their  lives  had  been  devastated  by  World  War  II,  and  they  struggled  
with  existential  issues  including  feelings  of  isolation,  alienation,  and  meaning-
lessness. Early writers focused on the individual’s experience of being alone in the 
world and facing the anxiety of this situation. The European existential perspec-
tive  focused  on  human  limitations  and  the  tragic  dimensions  of  life  (Sharp  &  
Bugental, 2001).
The  thinking  of  existential  psychologists  and  psychiatrists  was  influenced  by  
a  number  of  philosophers  and  writers  during  the  19th  century.  To  understand  
the  philosophical  underpinnings  of  modern  existential  psychotherapy,  one  must  
have some awareness of the cultural, philosophical, and religious writings of Søren 
Kierkegaard,  Friedrich  Nietzsche,  Martin  Heidegger,  Jean-Paul  Sartre,  and  Martin  
Buber.  These  major  figures  of  existentialism  and  existential  phenomenology  pro-
vided  the  basis  for  the  formation  of  existential  therapy.  Ludwig  Binswanger  and  
Medard  Boss  were  also  early  existential  psychoanalysts  who  contributed  key  ideas  
to  existential  psychotherapy.  Acknowledging  the  influence  of  these  early  philoso-
phers, Yalom found that each contributed significant themes that guided his own 
thinking:
From Kierkegaard: creative anxiety, despair, fear and dread, guilt, and 
nothingness
From Nietzsche: death, suicide, and will

From Heidegger: authentic being, caring, death, guilt, individual 
responsibility, and isolation

and self-transcendence
Søren  Kierkegaard  (1813–1855)  A  Danish  philosopher  and  Christian  theol- 
ogian,  Kierkegaard  was  particularly  concerned  with  angst—a  Danish  and  German  
word  whose  meaning  lies  between  the  English  words  dread  and  anxiety—and  he  
addressed the role of anxiety and uncertainty in life. Existential anxiety is associated 
with making basic decisions about how we want to live, and it is not pathological. 
Kierkegaard believed that anxiety is the school in which we are educated to be a self. 
Without the experience of angst, we may go through life as sleepwalkers. But many 
of us, especially in adolescence, are awakened into real life by a terrible uneasiness. 
Life  is  one  contingency  after  another,  with  no  guarantees  beyond  the  certainty  of  
death. This is by no means a comfortable state, but it is necessary to our becoming 
human. Kierkegaard believed that “the sickness unto death” arises when we are not 
true to ourselves. What is needed is the willingness to risk a leap of faith in making 
choices. Becoming human is a project, and our task is not so much to discover who 
we are as to create ourselves.
Friedrich  Nietzsche  (1844–1900)  The  German  philosopher  Nietzsche  is  the  
iconoclastic  counterpart  to  Kierkegaard,  expressing  a  revolutionary  approach  to  
the self, to ethics, and to society. Like Kierkegaard, he emphasized the importance 
of  subjectivity.  Nietzsche  set  out  to  prove  that  the  ancient  definition  of  humans  
as rational  was  entirely  misleading.  We  are  far  more  creatures  of  will  than  we  are  
impersonal  intellects.  But  where  Kierkegaard  emphasized  the  “subjective  truth”  
of  an  intense  concern  with  God,  Nietzsche  located  values  within  the  individual’s  
“will to power.” We give up an honest acknowledgment of this source of value when 
society invites us to rationalize powerlessness by advocating other worldly concerns. 
If, like sheep, we acquiesce in “herd morality,” we will be nothing but mediocrities. 
But if we release ourselves by giving free rein to our will to power, we will tap our 
potentiality  for  creativity  and  originality.  Kierkegaard  and  Nietzsche,  with  their  
pioneering  analyses  of  anxiety,  depression,  subjectivity,  and  the  authentic  self,  
together are generally considered to be the originators of the existential perspective 
(Sharp & Bugental, 2001).
Martin  Heidegger  (1889–1976)  Heidegger’s  phenomenological  existentialism  
reminds  us  that  we  exist  “in  the  world”  and  should  not  try  to  think  of  ourselves  
as  beings  apart  from  the  world  into  which  we  are  thrown.  The  way  we  fill  our  
everyday life with superficial conversation and routine shows that we often assume 
we are going to live forever and can afford to waste day after day. Our moods and 
feelings (including anxiety about death) are a way of understanding whether we are 
living authentically or whether we are inauthentically constructing our life around 
the  expectations  of  others.  When  we  translate  this  wisdom  from  vague  feeling  to  
explicit  awareness,  we  may  develop  a  more  positive  resolve  about  how  we  want  to  
be. Phenomenological existentialism, as presented by Heidegger, provides a view of

human history that does not focus on past events but motivates individuals to look 
forward to “authentic experiences” that are yet to come.
Martin  Buber  (1878–1965)  Leaving  Germany  to  live  in  the  new  state  of  Israel,  
Buber took a less individualistic stand than most of the other existentialists. He said 
that  we  humans  live  in  a  kind  of  betweenness;  that  is,  there  is  never  just  an  I,  but  
always an other. The I, the person who is the agent, changes depending on whether 
the other is an it or a Thou. But sometimes we make the serious mistake of reducing 
another person to the status of a mere object, in which case the relationship becomes 
I/it. Although Buber recognizes that of necessity we must have many I/it interactions 
(in everyday life), we are seriously limited if we live only in the world of the I/it. Buber 
stresses the importance of presence, which has three functions: (1) it enables true I/
Thou relationships; (2) it allows for meaning to exist in a situation; and (3) it enables 
an  individual  to  be  responsible  in  the  here  and  now  (Gould,  1993).  In  a  famous  
dialogue  with  Carl  Rogers,  Buber  argued  that  the  therapist  and  the  client  could  
never be on the same footing because the latter comes to the former for help. When 
the relationship is fully mutual, we have become “dialogic,” a fully human condition.
Ludwig Binswanger (1881–1966) An existential analyst, Binswanger proposed 
a holistic model of self that addresses the relationship between the person and his 
or her environment. He used a phenomenological approach to explore significant 
features of the self, including choice, freedom, and caring. He based his existential 
approach  largely  on  the  ideas  of  Heidegger  and  accepted  Heidegger’s  notion  that  
we  are  “thrown  into  the  world.”  However,  this  “thrown-ness”  does  not  release  us  
from  the  responsibility  of  our  choices  and  for  planning  for  the  future  (Gould,  
1993). 
existential analysis (Daseinanalysis) emphasizes the subjective and spiritual 
dimensions of human existence. Binswanger (1975) contended that crises in therapy 
were typically major choice points for the client. Although he originally looked to 
psychoanalytic  theory  to  shed  light  on  psychosis,  he  moved  toward  an  existential  
view of his patients. This perspective enabled him to understand the worldview and 
immediate  experience  of  his  patients,  as  well  as  the  meaning  of  their  behavior,  as  
opposed to superimposing his view as a therapist on their experience and behavior.
Medard  Boss  (1903–1991)  Both  Binswanger  and  Boss  were  early  existential  
psychoanalysts    and    significant    figures    in    the    development    of    existential    
psychotherapy.  They  talked  of  dasein,  or  being-in-the-world,  which  pertains  to  our  
ability to reflect on life events and attribute meaning to these events. They believed 
the therapist must enter the client’s subjective world without presuppositions that 
would get in the way of this experiential understanding. Both Binswanger and Boss 
were  significantly  influenced  by  Heidegger’s  seminal  work,  Being  and  Time  (1962),  
which provided a broad basis for understanding the individual (May, 1958). Boss 
was deeply influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis, but even more so by Heidegger. 
Boss’s major professional interest was applying Heidegger’s philosophical notions 
to  therapeutic  practice,  and  he  was  especially  concerned  with  integrating  Freud’s  
methods  with  Heidegger’s  concepts,  as  described  in  his  book  Daseinanalysis  and  
Psychoanalysis (1963).

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) A philosopher and novelist, Sartre was convinced, 
in  part  by  his  years  in  the  French  Resistance  in  World  War  II,  that  humans  are  
even  more  free  than  earlier  existentialists  had  believed.  The  existence  of  a  space—
nothingness—between the whole of our past and the now frees us to choose what we 
will. Our values are what we choose. The failure to acknowledge our freedom and 
choices results in emotional problems. This freedom is hard to face, so we tend to 
invent an excuse by saying, “I can’t change now because of my past conditioning.” 
Sartre called excuses “bad faith.” No matter what we have been, we can make choices 
now and become something quite different. We are condemned to be free. To choose 
is to become committed; this is the responsibility that is the other side of freedom. 
Sartre’s view was that at every moment, by our actions, we are choosing who we are 
being. Our existence is never fixed or finished. Every one of our actions represents a 
fresh choice. When we attempt to pin down who we are, we engage in self-deception 
(Russell, 2007).
Key Figures in Contemporary Existential Psychotherapy
Viktor Frankl, Rollo May, and Irvin Yalom (featured at the beginning of the chap-
ter)  created  their  existential  approaches  to  psychotherapy  from  their  strong  back-
grounds  in  both  existential  and  humanistic  psychology.  James  Bugental  has  also  
made major contributions to the development of existential therapy in the United 
States,  and  Emmy  van  Deurzen  continues  to  influence  the  practice  of  existential  
therapy in Great Britain.
James Bugental (1915–2008) James Bugental (1987) wrote about life-changing 
psychotherapy, which is the effort to help clients examine how they have answered 
life’s  existential  questions  and  to  invite  them  to  revise  their  answers  so  they  can  
live   more   authentically.   Bugental   coined   the   term   “existential-humanistic”   
psychotherapy, and he was a leading spokesman for this approach. His philosophical 
and  therapeutic  approach  included  a  curiosity  and  focus  that  moved  him  away  
from  the  traditional  therapeutic  milieu  of  labeling  and  diagnosing  clients.  His  
work emphasized the cultivation of both client and therapist presence. He developed 
interventions  to  assist  the  client  in  deepening  inner  exploration,  or  searching.  The  
therapist’s  primary  task  involved  helping  clients  make  new  discoveries  about  
themselves in the living moment, as opposed to merely talking about themselves.
Central to Bugental’s approach is his view of resistance, which from an existen-
tial-humanistic perspective is not resistance to therapy per se but rather to being fully 
present  both  during  the  therapy  hour  and  in  life.  Resistance  is  seen  as  part  of  the  
self-and-world construct—how a person understands his or her being and relationship 
to the world at large. Forms of resistance include intellectualizing, being argumen-
tative,  always  seeking  to  please,  and  any  other  life-limiting  pattern.  As  resistance  
emerges in the therapy sessions, the therapist repeatedly notes, or “tags,” the resis-
tance  so  the  client  increases  his  or  her  awareness  and  ultimately  has  an  increased  
range of choices.
Bugental’s  theory  and  practice  emphasized  the  distinction  between  therapeu-
tic  process  and  content.  He  became  known  for  being  a  masterful  teacher  and  psy-
chotherapist, primarily because he lived his work. He was an existentialist at heart,

which made him a great model and mentor, not only for clients but also for students 
and  professionals.  In  his  workshops,  he  developed  many  exercises  to  help  thera-
pists refine and practice their skills. He frequently brought his interventions to life 
with  live  demonstrations,  which  emphasized  therapeutic  work  taking  place  in  the  
moment, impromptu here-and-now dialogue, and exploring in the context of self as 
client or therapist. Bugental’s (1987) classic text, The Art of the Psychotherapist, is widely 
recognized for deconstructing the therapy process and moving beyond theory and 
generalizations to show what actually occurs moment-to-moment in the therapeu-
tic encounter. Psychotherapy Isn’t What You Think (Bugental, 1999) is the last book he 
wrote before he died in 2008, at the age of 93.
British  Contribution  to  Existential  Therapy  Emmy  van  Deurzen,  a  key  contri- 
butor  to  British  existential  psychology,  is  a  philosopher,  psychotherapist,  and  
counseling psychologist. Deurzen has earned a worldwide reputation in existential 
psychotherapy  through  her  many  books  and  her  role  in  teaching  and  training.  
Deurzen  (2012)  states  that  existential  therapy  is  not  designed  to  “cure”  people  of  
illness  in  the  tradition  of  the  medical  model  because  people  are  not  sick  but  are  
“sick of life or clumsy at living” (p. 30). Deurzen’s (2014) psychotherapy practice has 
taught her that individuals have incredible resilience and intelligence in overcoming 
their  problems  once  they  commit  themselves  to  a  self-searching  process.  Her  
therapy clients find meaning in their past hardships rather than experiencing these 
difficulties  as  defining  them  in  old  patterns.  Her  clients  are  able  to  recognize  the  
contradictions and paradoxes of life and to face their troubles and solve dilemmas. 
They also discover what is most important in life.
Deurzen is the cofounder of the New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling, 
which is developing academic and training programs. In the past decades the exis-
tential  approach  has  spread  rapidly  in  Britain  and  is  now  an  alternative  to  tradi-
tional  methods  (Deurzen,  2002,  2012).  For  a  description  of  the  historical  context  
and development of existential therapy in Britain, see Deurzen (2002), Deurzen and 
Adams (2011), and Cooper (2003); for an excellent overview of the theory and prac-
tice of existential therapy, see Deurzen (2012) and Schneider and Krug (2010). For 
information  on  the  New  School  in  Britain,  see  the  Other  Resources  section  at  the  
end of this chapter.
Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
The crucial significance of the existential movement is that it reacts against 
the  tendency  to  identify  therapy  with  a  set  of  techniques.  Instead,  it  bases  thera-
peutic practice on an understanding of what it means to be human. The existential 
movement  stands  for  respect  for  the  person,  for  exploring  new  aspects  of  human  
behavior,  and  for  divergent  methods  of  understanding  people.  It  uses  numerous  
approaches to therapy based on its assumptions about human nature.
The existential  tradition  seeks  a  balance  between  recognizing  the  limits  
and  tragic  dimensions  of  human  existence  on  one  hand  and  the  possibilities  and

opportunities of human life on the other hand. It grew out of a desire to help people 
engage the dilemmas of contemporary life, such as isolation, alienation, and mean-
inglessness.  The  current  focus  of  the  existential  approach  is  on  the  individual’s  
experience of being in the world alone and facing the anxiety of this isolation. “No 
relationship can eliminate existential isolation, but aloneness can be shared in such 
a way that love compensates for its pain” (Yalom & Josselson, 2014, p. 281).
The existential view of human nature is captured, in part, by the notion that the 
significance of our existence is never fixed once and for all; rather, we continually re-
create ourselves through our projects. Humans are in a constant state of transition, 
emerging, evolving, and becoming in response to the tensions, contradictions, and 
conflicts  in  our  lives.  Being  a  person  implies  that  we  are  discovering  and  making  
sense  of  our  existence.  We  continually  question  ourselves,  others,  and  the  world.  
Although the specific questions we raise vary in accordance with our developmen-
tal stage in life, the fundamental themes do not vary. We pose the same questions 
philosophers have pondered throughout Western history: “Who am I?” “What can I 
know?” “What ought I to do?” “What can I hope for?” “Where am I going?”
The  basic  dimensions  of  the  human  condition,  according  to  the  existential  
approach, include (1) the capacity for self-awareness; (2) freedom and responsibility; 
(3)  creating  one’s  identity  and  establishing  meaningful  relationships  with  others;  
(4) the search for meaning, purpose, values, and goals; (5) anxiety as a condition of 
living; and (6) awareness of death and nonbeing. I develop these propositions in the 
following sections by summarizing themes that emerge in the writings of existential 
philosophers and psychotherapists, and I also discuss the implications for counsel-
ing practice of each of these propositions.
Proposition 1: The Capacity for Self-Awareness
Freedom, choice, and responsibility constitute the foundation of self-awareness. The 
greater our awareness, the greater our possibilities for freedom (see Proposition 2). We 
increase our capacity to live fully as we expand our awareness in the following areas:
We are finite and do not have unlimited time to do what we want  
in life.
We have the potential to take action or not to act; inaction is a decision.
We choose our actions, and therefore we can partially create our own 
destiny.
Meaning is the product of discovering how we are “thrown” or situated 
in the world and then, through commitment, living creatively.
As we increase our awareness of the choices available to us, we also 
increase our sense of responsibility for the consequences of these choices.
We are subject to loneliness, meaninglessness, emptiness, guilt,  
and isolation.
We are basically alone, yet we have an opportunity to relate to other 
beings.
We  can  choose  either  to  expand  or  to  restrict  our  consciousness.  Because  self-
awareness is at the root of most other human capacities, the decision to expand it

is fundamental to human growth. Here are some areas of emerging awareness that 
individuals may experience in the counseling process:
They see how they are trading the security of dependence for the anxiet-
ies that accompany choosing for themselves.
They begin to see that their identity is anchored in someone else’s defi-
nition of them; that is, they are seeking approval and confirmation of 
their being in others instead of looking to themselves for affirmation.
They learn that in many ways they are keeping themselves prisoner by 
some of their past decisions, and they realize that they can make new 
decisions.
They learn that although they cannot change certain events in their 
lives they can change the way they view and react to these events.
They learn that they are not condemned to a future similar to the past, 
for they can learn from their past and thereby reshape their future.
They realize that they are so preoccupied with suffering, death, and 
dying that they are not appreciating living.
They are able to accept their limitations yet still feel worthwhile, for 
they understand that they do not need to be perfect to feel worthy.
They come to realize that they are failing to live in the present moment 
because of preoccupation with the past, planning for the future, or try-
ing to do too many things at once.
Increasing  self-awareness—which  includes  awareness  of  alternatives,  motiva-
tions, factors influencing the person, and personal goals—is an aim of all counsel-
ing. Clients need to learn that a price must be paid for increased awareness. As we 
become more aware, it is more difficult to “go home again.” Ignorance of our condi-
tion may have brought contentment along with a feeling of partial deadness, but as 
we open the doors in our world, we can expect more turmoil as well as the potential 
for more fulfillment.
Proposition 2: Freedom and Responsibility
A characteristic existential theme is that people are free to choose among alterna-
tives  and  therefore  play  a  large  role  in  shaping  their  own  destiny.  Schneider  and  
Krug (2010) write that existential therapy embraces three values: (1) the freedom to 
become  within  the  context  of  natural  and  self-imposed  limitations;  (2)  the  capacity 
to  reflect  on  the  meaning  of  our  choices;  and  (3)  the  capacity  to  act  on  the  choices  
we  make.  Although  we  do  not  choose  the  circumstances  into  which  we  are  born,  
we create our own destiny by the choices we make. Sartre claims we are constantly 
confronted  with  the  choice  of  what  kind  of  person  we  are  becoming,  and  to  exist  
is  never  to  be  finished  with  this  kind  of  choosing.  Living  an  authentic  existence  
requires that we assume responsibility for our choices (Ruben & Lichtanski, 2015).
A central existential concept is that although we long for freedom we often try 
to escape from our freedom by defining ourselves as a fixed or static entity (Russell, 
2007). Jean-Paul Sartre (1971) refers to this as the inauthenticity of not accepting 
personal responsibility. We can then avoid choosing and instead make excuses such

as  these:  “Since  that’s  the  way  I’m  made,  I  couldn’t  help  what  I  did”  or  “Naturally  
I’m this way, because I grew up in a dysfunctional family.” An inauthentic mode of 
existence  consists  of  lacking  awareness  of  personal  responsibility  for  our  lives  and  
passively assuming that our existence is largely controlled by external forces.
Freedom implies that we are responsible for our lives, for our actions, and for 
our failures to take action. From Sartre’s perspective, people are condemned to free-
dom. He calls for a commitment to choosing for ourselves. 
existential guilt is being 
aware of having evaded a commitment, or having chosen not to choose. This guilt is 
a condition that grows out of a sense of incompleteness, or a realization that we are 
not what we might have become. Guilt may be a sign that we have failed to rise to the 
challenge of our anxiety and that we have tried to evade it by not doing what we know 
is  possible  for  us  to  do  (Deurzen,  2012).  This  condition  is  not  viewed  as  neurotic,  
nor is it seen as a symptom that needs to be cured. Existential guilt can be a power-
ful source of motivation toward transformation and living authentically (Ruben & 
Lichtanski, 2015). The existential therapist explores this guilt to see what clients can 
learn about the ways in which they are living their life. This guilt also results from 
allowing others to define us or to make our choices for us. Sartre said, “We are our 
choices.” 
authenticity implies that we are living by being true to our own evaluation 
of what is a valuable existence for ourselves; it is the courage to be who we are. One of 
the aims of existential therapy is to help people face up to the difficulties of life with 
courage rather than avoiding life’s struggles (Deurzen & Adams, 2011).
For existentialists, then, being free and being human are identical. Freedom and 
responsibility go hand in hand. We are the authors of our lives in the sense that we 
create  our  destiny,  our  life  situation,  and  our  problems  (Russell,  1978).  Assuming  
responsibility is a basic condition for change. Clients who refuse to accept responsi-
bility by persistently blaming others for their problems are not likely to profit from 
therapy.
Frankl  (1978)  also  links  freedom  with  responsibility.  He  suggested  that  the  
Statue of Liberty on the East Coast should be balanced with a Statue of Responsibil-
ity on the West Coast. His basic premise is that freedom is bound by certain limita-
tions. We are not free from conditions, but we are free to take a stand against these 
restrictions. Ultimately, these conditions are subject to our decisions, which means 
we are responsible.
The therapist assists clients in discovering how they are avoiding freedom and 
encourages them to learn to risk using it. Not to do so is to cripple clients and make 
them dependent on the therapist. Therapists have the task of teaching clients that 
they can explicitly accept that they have choices, even though they may have devoted 
most of their life to evading them. Those who are in therapy often have mixed feel-
ings when it comes to choice. As Russell (2007) puts it: “We resent it when we don’t 
have choices, but we get anxious when we do! Existentialism is all about broadening 
the vision of our choices” (p. 111).
People often seek psychotherapy because they feel that they have lost control of 
how they are living. They may look to the counselor to direct them, give them advice, 
or  produce  magical  cures.  They  may  also  need  to  be  heard  and  understood.  Two  
central tasks of the therapist are inviting clients to recognize how they have allowed 
others to decide for them and encouraging them to take steps toward choosing for 
themselves. In inviting clients to explore other ways of being that are more fulfilling

than  their  present  restricted  existence,  some  existential  counselors  ask,  “Although  
you have lived in a certain pattern, now that you recognize the price of some of your 
ways, are you willing to consider creating new patterns?” Others may have a vested 
interest in keeping the client in an old pattern, so the initiative for changing it will 
have to come from the client.
Cultural factors need to be taken into account in assisting clients in the process 
of  examining  their  choices.  A  person  who  is  struggling  with  feeling  limited  by  her  
family situation can be invited to look at her part in this process and values that are 
a part of her culture. For example, Meta, a Norwegian American, is working to attain 
a professional identity as a social worker, but her family thinks she is being selfish 
and  neglecting  her  primary  duties.  The  family  is  likely  to  exert  pressure  on  her  to  
give up her personal interests in favor of what they feel is best for the welfare of the 
entire family. Meta may feel trapped in the situation and see no way out unless she 
rejects what her family wants. In cases such as this, it is useful to explore the client’s 
underlying values and to help her determine whether her values are working for her 
and for her family. Clients such as Meta have the challenge of weighing values and 
balancing  behaviors  between  two  cultures.  Ultimately,  Meta  must  decide  in  what  
ways  she  might  change  her  situation,  and  she  needs  to  assess  values  based  on  her  
culture. The existential therapist will invite Meta to begin to explore what she can do 
and to realize that she can be authentic in spite of pressures on her by her situation. 
According to Vontress (2013), we can be authentic in any society, whether we are a 
part of an individualistic or collectivistic society.
It is essential to respect the purpose that people have in mind when they initiate 
therapy. If we pay careful attention to what our clients tell us about what they want, 
we  can  operate  within  an  existential  framework.  We  can  encourage  individuals  to  
weigh the alternatives and to explore the consequences of what they are doing with 
their lives. Although oppressive forces may be severely limiting the quality of their 
lives,  we  can  help  people  see  that  they  are  not  solely  the  victims  of  circumstances  
beyond their control. Even though we sometimes cannot control things that happen 
to us, we have complete control over how we choose to perceive and handle them. 
Although our freedom to act is limited by external reality, our freedom to be relates 
to  our  internal  reality.  At  the  same  time  that  people  are  learning  how  to  change   
their external environment, they can be challenged to look within themselves to rec-
ognize their own contributions to their problems. Through the therapy experience, 
clients  may  be  able  to  discover  new  courses  of  action  that  will  lead  to  a  change  in  
their situation.
Proposition 3: Striving for Identity and Relationship to Others
People  are  concerned  about  preserving  their  uniqueness  and  centeredness,  yet  at  
the  same  time  they  have  an  interest  in  going  outside  of  themselves  to  relate  to  
other  beings  and  to  nature.  Each  of  us  would  like  to  discover  a  self  or,  to  put  it  
more  authentically,  to  create  our  personal  identity.  This  is  not  an  automatic  pro-
cess, and creating an identity takes courage. As relational beings, we also strive for 
connectedness  with  others.  Many  existential  writers  discuss  loneliness,  uprooted-
ness, and alienation, which can be seen as the failure to develop ties with others and 
with nature.

The trouble with so many of us is that we have sought directions, answers, val-
ues, and beliefs from the important people in our world. Rather than trusting our-
selves to search within and find our own answers to the conflicts in our life, we sell 
out by becoming what others expect of us. Our being becomes rooted in their expec-
tations, and we become strangers to ourselves.
The Courage to Be Paul Tillich (1886–1965), a leading Protestant theologian of 
the 20th century, believed awareness of our finite nature gives us an appreciation of 
ultimate concerns. It takes courage to discover the true “ground of our being” and to 
use its power to transcend those aspects of nonbeing that would destroy us (Tillich, 
1952).  Courage  entails  the  will  to  move  forward  in  spite  of  anxiety-producing  
situations, such as facing our death (May, 1975). We struggle to discover, to create, 
and to maintain the core deep within our being. One of the greatest fears of clients 
is that they will discover that there is no core, no self, no substance, and that they are 
merely reflections of everyone’s expectations of them. A client may say, “My fear is 
that I’ll discover I’m nobody, that there really is nothing to me. I’ll find out that I’m 
an empty shell, hollow inside, and nothing will exist if I shed my masks.” If clients 
demonstrate the courage to confront these fears, they might well leave therapy with 
an increased tolerance for the uncertainty of life. By assisting clients in facing the 
fear that their lives or selves are empty and meaningless, therapists can help clients 
to create a self that has meaning and substance that they have chosen.
Existential  therapists  may  begin  by  asking  their  clients  to  allow  themselves  to  
intensify the feeling that they are nothing more than the sum of others’ expectations 
and  that  they  are  merely  the  introjects  of  parents  and  parent  substitutes.  How  do  
they feel now? Are they condemned to stay this way forever? Is there a way out? Can 
they create a self if they find that they are without one? Where can they begin? Once 
clients  have  demonstrated  the  courage  to  recognize  this  fear,  to  put  it  into  words  
and share it, it does not seem so overwhelming. I find that it is best to begin work by 
inviting clients to accept the ways in which they have lived outside themselves and to 
explore ways in which they are out of contact with themselves.
The  Experience  of  Aloneness  The  existentialists  postulate  that  part  of  the  
human  condition  is  the  experience  of  aloneness.  But  they  add  that  we  can  derive  
strength  from  the  experience  of  looking  to  ourselves  and  sensing  our  separation.  
The sense of isolation comes when we recognize that we cannot depend on anyone 
else for our own confirmation; that is, we alone must give a sense of meaning to life, 
and  we  alone  must  decide  how  we  will  live.  If  we  are  unable  to  tolerate  ourselves  
when we are alone, how can we expect anyone else to be enriched by our company? 
Before we can have any solid relationship with another, we must have a relationship 
with ourselves. We are challenged to learn to listen to ourselves. We have to be able 
to stand alone before we can truly stand beside another.
The Experience of Relatedness We humans depend on relationships with others. 
We  want  to  be  significant  in  another’s  world,  and  we  want  to  feel  that  another’s  
presence is important in our world. When we are able to stand alone and tap into 
our  own  strength,  our  relationships  with  others  are  based  on  our  fulfillment,  not  
our  deprivation.  If  we  feel  personally  deprived,  however,  we  can  expect  little  but  a  
clinging and symbiotic relationship with someone else.

EXISTEnTIAl THERAPy         143 
Perhaps  one  of  the  functions  of  therapy  is  to  help  clients  distinguish  between  
a  neurotically  dependent  attachment  to  another  and  a  life-affirming  relationship  
in  which  both  persons  are  enhanced.  The  therapist  can  challenge  clients  to  exam-
ine  what  they  get  from  their  relationships,  how  they  avoid  intimate  contact,  how  
they prevent themselves from having equal relationships, and how they might create 
therapeutic, healthy, and mature human relationships. Existential therapists speak 
of  intersubjectivity,  which  is  the  fact  of  our  interrelatedness  with  others  and  the  
need for us to struggle with this in a creative way.
Struggling With Our Identity Because of our fear of dealing with our aloneness, 
Farha (1994) points out that some of us get caught up in ritualistic behavior patterns 
that cement us to an image or identity we acquired in early childhood. We become 
trapped  in  a  doing  mode  to  avoid  the  experience  of  being.  Part  of  the  therapeutic  
journey  consists  of  the  therapist  challenging  clients  to  begin  to  examine  the  ways  
in which they have lost touch with their identity, especially by letting others design 
their life for them. The therapy process itself is often frightening for clients when 
they  realize  that  they  have  surrendered  their  freedom  to  others  and  that  in  the  
therapy  relationship  they  will  have  to  assume  their  freedom  again.  By  refusing  to  
give easy solutions or answers, existential therapists confront clients with the reality 
that they alone must find their own answers.
Proposition 4: The Search for Meaning
A  distinctly  human  characteristic  is  the  struggle  for  a  sense  of  significance  and  
purpose  in  life.  In  my  experience  the  underlying  conflicts  that  bring  people  into  
counseling and therapy are centered in these existential questions: “Why am I here?” 
“What do I want from life?” “What gives my life purpose?” “Where is the source of 
meaning for me in life?”
Existential  therapy  can  provide  the  conceptual  framework  for  helping  clients  
challenge  the  meaning  in  their  lives.  Questions  that  the  therapist  might  ask  are,  
“Do you like the direction of your life?” “Are you pleased with what you now are and 
what you are becoming?” “If you are confused about who you are and what you want 
for yourself, what are you doing to get some clarity?”
The  Problem  of  Discarding  Old  Values  One  of  the  problems  in  therapy  is  
that  clients  may  discard  traditional  (and  imposed)  values  without  creating  other,  
suitable  ones  to  replace  them.  What  does  the  therapist  do  when  clients  no  longer  
cling to values that they never really challenged or internalized and now experience 
a  vacuum?  Clients  may  report  that  they  feel  like  a  boat  without  a  rudder.  They  
seek new guidelines and values that are appropriate for the newly discovered facets 
of  themselves,  and  yet  for  a  time  they  are  without  them.  One  of  the  tasks  of  the  
therapeutic process is to help clients create a value system based on a way of living 
that is consistent with their way of being.
The  therapist’s  job  is  to  trust  in  the  capacity  of  clients  to  eventually  create  an  
internally derived value system that provides the foundation for a meaningful life. 
They  will  no  doubt  flounder  for  a  time  and  experience  anxiety  as  a  result  of  the  
absence of clear-cut values. The therapist’s trust is important in helping clients trust 
their own capacity to create a new source of values.

Meaninglessness  According  to  Frankl  (1963),  the  central  human  concern  is  to  
discover meaning that will give one’s life direction. Frankl’s life experiences and his 
clinical work led him to the conclusion that a lack of meaning is the major source 
of existential stress and anxiety in modern times. He views existential neurosis as 
the  experience  of  meaninglessness.  When  the  world  we  live  in  seems  meaningless,  
we may wonder whether it is worth it to continue struggling or even living. Faced 
with the prospect of our mortality, we might ask, “Is there any point to what I do 
now, since I will eventually die? Will what I do be forgotten when I am gone? Given 
the  fact  of  mortality,  why  should  I  busy  myself  with  anything?”  A  man  in  one  of  
my groups captured precisely the idea of personal significance when he said, “I feel 
like another page in a book that has been turned quickly, and nobody bothered to 
read the page.” Frankl believes that such a feeling of meaninglessness is the major 
existential neurosis of modern life.
Meaninglessness  in  life  can  lead  to  emptiness  and  hollowness,  or  a  condition  
that  Frankl  calls  the  existential  vacuum.  This  condition  is  often  experienced  
when  people  do  not  busy  themselves  with  routine  or  with  work.  Because  there  is  
no  preordained  design  for  living,  people  are  faced  with  the  task  of  creating  their  
own meaning. At times people who feel trapped by the emptiness of life withdraw 
from the struggle of creating a life with purpose. Experiencing meaninglessness and 
establishing values that are part of a meaningful life are issues that become the heart 
of counseling.
Creating  New  Meaning Logotherapy  is  designed  to  help  clients  find  meaning  
in life. The therapist’s function is not to tell clients what their particular meaning 
in  life  should  be  but  to  point  out  that  they  can  create  meaning  even  in  suffering  
(Frankl,  1978).  This  view  holds  that  human  suffering  (the  tragic  and  negative  
aspects of life) can be turned into human achievement by the stand an individual 
takes when faced with it. Frankl also contends that people who confront pain, guilt, 
despair, and death can effectively deal with their despair and thus triumph.
Yet meaning is not something that we can directly search for and obtain. Para-
doxically, the more rationally we seek it, the more likely we are to miss it. Meaning 
is created out of an individual’s engagement with what is valued, and this commit-
ment  provides  the  purpose  that  makes  life  worthwhile  (Deurzen,  2012).  I  like  the  
way Vontress (2013) captures the idea that meaning in life is an ongoing process we 
struggle  with  throughout  our  life:  “What  provides  meaning  one  day  may  not  pro-
vide meaning the next, and what has been meaningful to a person throughout life 
may be meaningless when a person is on his or her deathbed” (p. 147).
Proposition 5: Anxiety as a Condition of Living
Anxiety arises from one’s personal strivings to survive and to maintain and assert 
one’s being, and the feelings anxiety generates are an inevitable aspect of the human 
condition. 
existential anxiety is the unavoidable result of being confronted with 
the  “givens  of  existence”—death,  freedom,  choice,  isolation,  and  meaninglessness  
(Vontress,  2013;  Yalom,  1980;  Yalom  &  Josselson,  2014).  Existential  anxiety  arises  
as we recognize the realities of our mortality, our confrontation with pain and suf-
fering, our need to struggle for survival, and our basic fallibility. We experience this

EXISTEnTIAl THERAPy         145 
anxiety  as  we  become  increasingly  aware  of  our  freedom  and  the  consequences  of  
accepting or rejecting that freedom. In fact, when we make a decision that involves 
reconstruction  of  our  life,  the  accompanying  anxiety  can  be  a  signal  that  we  are  
ready for personal change and can be a stimulus for growth. If we learn to listen to 
the subtle messages of anxiety, we can dare to take the steps necessary to change the 
direction of our lives.
Existential  therapists  differentiate  between  normal  and  neurotic  anxiety,  and  
they  see  anxiety  as  a  potential  source  of  growth.  
normal  anxiety  is  an  appropri-
ate response to an event being faced. Accepting freedom and the responsibility for 
making decisions and life choices, searching for meaning, and facing mortality can 
be  frightening.  This  kind  of  anxiety  does  not  have  to  be  repressed,  and  it  can  be  a  
powerful motivational force toward change and growth (Ruben & Lichtanski, 2015). 
From the existential viewpoint, normal anxiety is an invitation to freedom. “Anxiety 
is  a  teacher,  not  an  obstacle  or  something  to  be  removed  or  avoided”  (Deurzen  &  
Adams, 2011, p. 24).
Failure  to  move  through  anxiety  results  in  neurotic  anxiety,  which  is  anxiety  
about concrete things that is out of proportion to the situation. Neurotic anxiety is 
typically out of awareness, and it tends to immobilize the person. Being psychologi-
cally healthy entails living with as little neurotic anxiety as possible, while accepting 
and struggling with the unavoidable existential anxiety that is a part of living.
Many people who seek counseling want solutions that will enable them to elimi-
nate anxiety. Creating the illusion that there is security in life may help us cope with 
the unknown, yet we know on some level that we are deceiving ourselves. Deurzen 
(2012)  believes  that  existential  anxiety  is  part  of  living  with  awareness  and  being  
fully alive. In fact, the courage to live fully entails accepting the reality of death and 
the anxiety associated with uncertainty. Facing existential anxiety involves viewing 
life as an adventure rather than hiding behind imagined securities that seem to offer 
protection.  Opening  up  to  new  life  means  opening  up  to  anxiety.  We  pay  a  steep  
price when we short-circuit anxiety.
The existential therapist can help clients recognize that learning how to tolerate 
ambiguity and uncertainty and how to live without props can be a necessary phase 
in the journey from dependence to autonomy. The therapist and client can explore 
the  possibility  that  although  breaking  away  from  crippling  patterns  and  building  
new ways of living will be fraught with anxiety for a while, anxiety will diminish as 
the  client  experiences  more  satisfaction  with  newer  ways  of  being.  When  a  client  
becomes more self-confident, the anxiety that results from an expectation of catas-
trophe is likely to decrease.
Proposition 6: Awareness of Death and Nonbeing
The existentialist does not view death negatively but holds that awareness of death 
as  a  basic  human  condition  gives  significance  to  living.  A  distinguishing  human  
characteristic  is  the  ability  to  grasp  the  reality  of  the  future  and  the  inevitability  
of death. It is necessary to think about death if we are to think significantly about 
life. Death should not be considered a threat; death provides the motivation for us 
to take advantage of appreciating the present moment. Instead of being frozen by 
the  fear  of  death,  reflecting  on  the  reality  of  death  can  teach  us  how  to  live  fully.

146            CHAPTER SIX 
Deurzen  and  Adams  (2011)  write:  “Life  is  a  taskmaster,  while  death  is  a  master  
teacher” (p. 105). If we defend ourselves against the reality of our eventual death, life 
becomes insipid and meaningless. But if we realize that we are mortal, we know that 
we do not have an eternity to complete our projects and that the present is crucial. 
Our awareness of death is the source of zest for life and creativity. Death and life are 
interdependent, and though physical death destroys us, the idea of death saves us 
(Yalom, 1980, 2003).
Yalom  (2008)  recommends  that  therapists  talk  directly  to  clients  about  the  
reality  of  death.  He  believes  the  fear  of  death  percolates  beneath  the  surface  and  
haunts us throughout life. Death is a visitor in the therapeutic process, and Yalom 
believes that ignoring its presence sends the message that death is too overwhelm-
ing  to  explore.  Confronting  this  fear  can  be  the  factor  that  helps  us  transform  an  
inauthentic mode of living into a more authentic one. Accepting the reality of our 
personal death can result in a major shift in the way we live in the world (Yalom & 
Josselson, 2014). We can turn our fear of death into a positive force when we accept 
the reality of our mortality. In Staring at the Sun: Overcoming the Terror of Death, Yalom 
(2008) develops the idea that confronting death enables us to live in a more compas-
sionate way.
One  focus  in  existential  therapy  is  on  exploring  the  degree  to  which  clients  
are  doing  the  things  they  value.  Without  being  morbidly  preoccupied  by  the  ever-
present threat of nonbeing, clients can develop a healthy awareness of death as a way 
to  evaluate  how  well  they  are  living  and  what  changes  they  want  to  make  in  their  
lives. Those who fear death also fear life. When we emotionally accept the reality of 
our  eventual  death,  we  realize  more  clearly  that  our  actions  do  count,  that  we  do  
have  choices,  and  that  we  must  accept  the  ultimate  responsibility  for  how  well  we  
are living (Corey & Corey, 2014).
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
Existential therapy is best considered as an invitation to clients to recognize 
the ways in which they are not living fully authentic lives and to make choices that 
will lead to their becoming what they are capable of being. An aim of therapy is to 
assist clients in moving toward authenticity and learning to recognize when they are 
deceiving themselves (Deurzen, 2012). The existential orientation holds that there 
is no escape from freedom as we will always be held responsible. We can relinquish 
our  freedom,  however,  which  is  the  ultimate  inauthenticity.  Existential  therapy   
aims at helping clients face anxiety and engage in action that is based on the authen-
tic  purpose  of  creating  a  worthy  existence.  Authenticity  involves  claiming  author-
ship—taking  responsibility  for  our  actions  and  the  way  we  are  living  (Deurzen   
& Adams, 2011).
May (1981) contends that people come to therapy with the self-serving illusion 
that they are inwardly enslaved and that someone else (the therapist) can free them. 
Existential  therapists  are  mainly  concerned  about  helping  people  to  reclaim  and  
reown their lives. The task of existential therapy is to teach clients to listen to what

they already know about themselves, even though they may not be attending to what 
they  know.  Schneider  and  Krug  (2010)  identify  four  essential  aims  of  existential-
humanistic therapy: (1) to help clients become more present to both themselves and 
others; (2) to assist clients in identifying ways they block themselves from fuller pres-
ence;  (3)  to  challenge  clients  to  assume  responsibility  for  designing  their  present  
lives; and (4) to encourage clients to choose more expanded ways of being in their 
daily lives.
Increased  awareness  is  the  central  goal  of  existential  therapy,  which  allows  
clients  to  discover  that  alternative  possibilities  exist  where  none  were  recognized  
before.  Clients  come  to  realize  that  they  are  able  to  make  changes  in  their  way  of  
being in the world.
Therapist’s Function and Role
Existential  therapists  are  primarily  concerned  with  understanding  the  subjective  
world  of  clients  to  help  them  come  to  new  understandings  and  options.  Existen-
tial  therapists  are  especially  concerned  about  clients  avoiding  responsibility;  they  
consistently invite clients to accept personal responsibility. When clients complain 
about the predicaments they are in and blame others, the therapist is likely to ask 
them how they contributed to their situation.
Therapists  with  an  existential  orientation  usually  deal  with  people  who  have  
what could be called a restricted existence. These clients have a limited awareness 
of themselves and are often vague about the nature of their problems. They may see 
few,  if  any,  options  for  dealing  with  life  situations,  and  they  tend  to  feel  trapped,  
helpless,  and  stuck.  One  of  the  therapist’s  functions  is  to  assist  clients  in  seeing  
the ways in which they constrict their awareness and the cost of such constrictions 
(Bugental, 1997). The therapist may hold up a mirror, so to speak, so that clients can 
gradually engage in self-confrontation. In this way clients can see how they became 
the way they are and how they might enlarge the way they live. Once clients are aware 
of  factors  in  their  past  and  of  stifling  modes  of  their  present  existence,  they  can  
begin to accept responsibility for changing their future.
Existential practitioners may make use of techniques that originate from diverse 
theoretical orientations, yet no set of techniques is considered essential. The thera-
peutic journey is creative and uncertain and different for each client. Russell (2007) 
captures this notion well when he writes: “There is no one right way to do therapy, 
and certainly no rigid doctrine for existentially rooted techniques. What is crucial is 
that you create your own authentic way of being attuned to your clients” (p. 123). 
Existential therapists encourage experimentation not only within the therapy office 
but also outside of the therapy setting, based on the belief that life outside therapy is 
what counts. Practitioners often ask clients to reflect on or write about problematic 
events they encounter in daily life (Schneider, 2011).
Client’s Experience in Therapy
Clients  in  existential  therapy  are  clearly  encouraged  to  assume  responsibility  for  
how they are currently choosing to be in their world. Effective therapy does not stop 
with this awareness itself, for the therapist encourages clients to take action on the 
basis of the insights they develop through the therapeutic process. Experimentation

with new ways of behaving in the outside world is necessary if clients are to change. 
Further,  clients  must  be  active  in  the  therapeutic  process,  for  during  the  sessions  
they must decide what fears, guilt feelings, and anxieties they will explore.
Merely deciding to enter psychotherapy is itself a frightening prospect for most 
people.  The  experience  of  opening  the  doors  to  oneself  can  be  frightening,  excit-
ing,  joyful,  depressing,  or  a  combination  of  all  of  these.  As  clients  wedge  open  the  
closed  doors,  they  also  begin  to  loosen  the  deterministic  shackles  that  have  kept  
them psychologically bound. Gradually, they become aware of what they have been 
and who they are now, and they are better able to decide what kind of future they 
want. Through the process of their therapy, individuals can explore alternatives for 
making their visions real.
When clients plead helplessness and attempt to convince themselves that they 
are powerless, May (1981) reminds them that their journey toward freedom began 
by putting one foot in front of the other to get to his office. As narrow as their range 
of  freedom  may  be,  individuals  can  begin  building  and  augmenting  that  range  by  
taking small steps. The therapeutic journey that opens up new horizons is poetically 
described by Deurzen (2010):
Embarking  on  our  existential  journey  requires  us  to  be  prepared  to  be  touched  
and shaken by what we find on the way and to not be afraid to discover our own 
limitations and weaknesses, uncertainties and doubts. It is only with such an atti-
tude  of  openness  and  wonder  that  we  can  encounter  the  impenetrable  everyday  
mysteries, which take us beyond our own preoccupations and sorrows and which 
by confronting us with death, make us rediscover life. (p. 5)
Another aspect of the experience of being a client in existential therapy is con-
fronting  ultimate  concerns  rather  than  coping  with  immediate  problems.  Rather  
than  being  solution-oriented,  existential  therapy  is  aimed  toward  removing  road-
blocks  to  meaningful  living  and  helping  clients  assume  responsibility  for  their  
actions (Yalom & Josselson, 2014). Existential therapists assist people in facing life 
with courage, hope, and a willingness to find meaning in life. Deurzen and Adams 
(2011)  maintain  that  a  therapist  must  resonate  with  the  client’s  experience  and  
struggle to face life honestly. This capacity for resonance must be honed constantly, 
and it requires the therapist to be fully present with the client and take part in the 
therapeutic encounter in a fully engaged manner.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Existential therapists give central prominence to their relationship with the 
client. The relationship is important in itself because the quality of this person-to-
person  encounter  in  the  therapeutic  situation  is  the  stimulus  for  positive  change.  
Attention is given to the client’s immediate, ongoing experience, especially what is 
going on in the interaction between the therapist and the client. Therapy is viewed 
as a social microcosm in the sense that the interpersonal and existential problems 
of the client will become apparent in the here and now of the therapy relationship 
(Yalom & Josselson, 2014).
Therapists  with  an  existential  orientation  believe  their  basic  attitudes  toward  
the client and their own personal characteristics of honesty, integrity, and courage

are what they have to offer. Therapy is a journey taken by therapist and client that 
delves deeply into the world as perceived and experienced by the client. But this type 
of  quest  demands  that  therapists  also  be  in  contact  with  their  own  phenomeno-
logical world. Existential therapy is a voyage into self-discovery and a journey of life-
discovery for both client and therapist (Deurzen, 2010; Yalom & Josselson, 2014).
Buber’s  (1970)  conception  of  the  I/Thou  relationship  has  significant  implica-
tions here. His understanding of the self is based on two fundamental relationships: 
the I/it and the I/Thou. The I/it is the relation to time and space, which is a necessary 
starting place for the self. The I/Thou is the relationship essential for connecting the 
self  to  the  spirit  and,  in  so  doing,  to  achieve  true  dialogue.  This  form  of  relation-
ship is the paradigm of the fully human self, the achievement of which is the goal 
of Buber’s existential philosophy. Relating in an I/Thou fashion means that there is 
direct, mutual, and present interaction. Rather than prizing therapeutic objectivity 
and professional distance, existential therapists strive to create caring and intimate 
relationships with clients.
The core of the therapeutic relationship is respect, which implies faith in clients’ 
potential  to  cope  authentically  with  their  troubles  and  in  their  ability  to  discover  
alternative ways of being. Existential therapists share their reactions to clients with 
genuine concern and empathy as one way of deepening the therapeutic relationship. 
Therapists invite clients to grow by modeling authentic behavior. If therapists keep 
themselves  hidden  during  the  therapeutic  session  or  if  they  engage  in  inauthentic  
behavior, clients will also remain guarded and persist in their inauthentic ways.
Bugental  (1987)  emphasizes  the  crucial  role  the  presence  of  the  therapist  plays  
in the therapeutic relationship. In his view many therapists and therapeutic systems 
overlook its fundamental importance. He contends that therapists are too often so 
concerned with the content of what is being said that they are not aware of the dis-
tance between themselves and their clients. Schneider (2011) believes that the thera-
pist’s presence is both a condition and a goal of therapeutic change. Presence serves 
the dual functions of reconnecting people to their pain and to attuning them to the 
opportunities to transform their pain.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The existential approach is unlike most other therapies in that it is not technique-
oriented.  Although  existentially  oriented  therapists  may  incorporate  many  tech-
niques from other models, these interventions are made within the context of striving 
to understand the subjective world of the client. The interventions existential practi-
tioners employ are based on philosophical views about the nature of human existence. 
These practitioners prefer description, understanding, and exploration of the client’s 
subjective reality, as opposed to diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis (Deurzen, 2002). 
“Existential  therapists  prefer  to  be  thought  of  as  philosophical  companions,  not  
as  people  who  repair  psyches”  (Vontress,  2013,  p.  150).  Yalom  and  Josselson  (2014)  
describe  existential  therapists  as  “fellow  travelers”  who  are  willing  to  make  them-
selves  known  through  appropriate  self-disclosure.  It  is  not  theories  and  techniques  
that  heal  but  the  encounter  that  occurs  between  client  and  therapist  as  they  work  
together (Elkins, 2007, 2016). Existential therapists are free to draw from techniques

that flow from many other orientations, but they have a set of assumptions and atti-
tudes that guide their interventions with clients. See Case Approach to Counseling and 
Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 4) for an illustration of how Dr. J. Michael Russell 
works in an existential way with some key themes in the case of Ruth.
A primary ground rule of existential work is the openness to the individual cre-
ativity of the therapist and the client. Existential therapists need to adapt their inter-
ventions to their own personality and style, as well as being sensitive to what each 
client requires. The main guideline is that the existential practitioner’s interventions 
are responsive to the uniqueness of each client (Deurzen, 2010).
Deurzen (2012) believes that the starting point for existential work is for practi-
tioners to clarify their views on life and living. She stresses the importance of thera-
pists reaching sufficient depth and openness in their own lives to venture into clients’ 
murky waters without getting lost. The nature of existential work is assisting people 
in  the  process  of  living  with  greater  expertise  and  ease.  Deurzen  (2010)  identifies  
how therapists make a difference with clients: “We help them to get better at reflect-
ing on their situation, deal with their dilemma, face their predicament and think for 
themselves” (p. 236). Deurzen reminds us that existential therapy is a collaborative 
adventure in which both client and therapist will be transformed if they allow them-
selves to be touched by life. When the deepest self of the therapist meets the deepest 
part of the client, the counseling process is at its best. Therapy is a creative, evolving 
process of discovery that can be conceptualized in three general phases.
Phases of Existential Counseling
During the initial phase of counseling, therapists assist clients in identifying 
and clarifying their assumptions about the world. Clients are invited to define and 
question  the  ways  in  which  they  perceive  and  make  sense  of  their  existence.  They  
examine  their  values,  beliefs,  and  assumptions  to  determine  their  validity.  This  is  
a  difficult  task  for  many  clients  because  they  may  initially  present  their  problems  
as  resulting  almost  entirely  from  external  causes.  They  may  focus  on  what  other  
people “make them feel” or on how others are largely responsible for their actions 
or inaction. The counselor teaches them how to reflect on their own existence and 
to examine their role in creating their problems in living.
During the middle phase of existential counseling, clients are assisted in more 
fully examining the source and authority of their present value system. This process 
of self-exploration typically leads to new insights and some restructuring of values 
and attitudes. Individuals get a better idea of what kind of life they consider worthy 
to live and develop a clearer sense of their internal valuing process.
The  final  phase  of  existential  counseling  focuses  on  helping  people  take  what  
they  are  learning  about  themselves  and  put  it  into  action.  Transformation  is  not  
limited to what takes place during the therapy hour. The therapeutic hour is a small 
contribution  to  a  person’s  renewed  engagement  with  life,  or  a  rehearsal  for  life  
(Deurzen, 2002). The aim of therapy is to enable clients to discover ways of imple-
menting their examined and internalized values in a concrete way between sessions 
and after therapy has terminated. Clients typically discover their strengths and find 
ways to put them to the service of living a purposeful existence.

Clients Appropriate for Existential Counseling
Existential practice has been applied in a variety of settings and with a diverse pop-
ulation  of  clients,  including  those  with  substance  abuse  issues,  ethnic  and  racial  
minorities, gay and lesbian clients, and psychiatric inpatients (Schneider, 2011). A 
strength  of  the  perspective  is  its  focus  on  available  choices  and  pathways  toward  
personal growth. For people who are coping with developmental crises, experienc-
ing  grief  and  loss,  confronting  death,  or  facing  a  major  life  decision,  existential  
therapy  is  especially  appropriate.  Some  examples  of  these  critical  turning  points  
that mark passages from one stage of life into another are the struggle for identity 
in  adolescence,  coping  with  possible  disappointments  in  middle  age,  adjusting  to  
children leaving home, coping with failures in marriage and work, and dealing with 
increased physical limitations as one ages. These developmental challenges involve 
both dangers and opportunities. Uncertainty, anxiety, and struggling with decisions 
are all part of this process.
Deurzen (2002) suggests that this form of therapy is most appropriate for clients 
who are committed to dealing with their problems about living, for people who feel 
alienated from the current expectations of society, or for those who are searching for 
meaning in their lives. It tends to work well with people who are at a crossroads and 
who question the state of affairs in the world and are willing to challenge the status 
quo. It can be useful for people who are on the edge of existence, such as those who 
are  dying  or  contemplating  suicide,  who  are  working  through  a  developmental  or  
situational crisis, who feel that they no longer belong in their surroundings, or who 
are starting a new phase of life.
Application to Brief Therapy
The existential approach can focus clients on significant areas such as assum-
ing  personal  responsibility,  making  a  commitment  to  deciding  and  acting,  and  
expanding their awareness of their current situation. It is possible for a time-lim-
ited approach to serve as a catalyst for clients to become actively and fully involved 
in each of their therapy sessions. Sharp and Bugental (2001) maintain that short-
term applications of the existential approach require more structuring and clearly 
defined  and  less  ambitious  goals.  At  the  termination  of  short-term  therapy,  it  is  
important for individuals to evaluate what they have accomplished and what issues 
may need to be addressed later. It is essential that both therapist and client deter-
mine that short-term work is appropriate, and that beneficial outcomes are likely.
Application to Group Counseling
An  existential  group  can  be  described  as  people  making  a  commitment  to  
a  lifelong  journey  of  self-exploration  with  these  goals:  (1)  enabling  members  to  
become honest with themselves, (2) widening their perspectives on themselves and 
the world around them, and (3) clarifying what gives meaning to their present and

future life (Deurzen, 2002). An open attitude toward life is essential, as is the will-
ingness to explore unknown territory. Recurring universal themes evolve in many 
groups  that  challenge  members  to  seriously  explore  existential  concerns  such  as  
the ability to choose a path in life, freedom and anxiety, how to live a meaningful 
life in the face of the reality of death, and how to establish authentic and mutual 
relationships (Leszcz, 2015). The heart of the work in an existential group is reduc-
ing avoidance of universal existential concerns because not addressing these themes 
diminishes  one’s  engagement  with  life.  The  group  leader  is  generally  more  of  a  
participant-observer who engages as an informed fellow traveler rather than as an 
aloof sage. Leszcz (2015) notes that the leader engages in appropriate self-disclosure 
and transparency, gives feedback, and shares his or her reactions within the group. 
Leader  disclosures  center  on  the  members’  interests  rather  than  on  the  leader’s  
needs or interests.
The existential group provides the optimal conditions for therapeutic work on 
responsibility. The members are responsible for the way they behave in the group, 
and this provides a mirror for how they are likely to act in the world. A group repre-
sents a microcosm of the world in which participants live and function. A group can 
be instrumental in helping members see how some of the self-constricting patterns 
they  manifest  in  the  group  parallel  patterns  in  their  everyday  life.  Over  time  the  
interpersonal  and  existential  problems  of  the  participants  become  evident  in  the  
here-and-now  interactions  within  the  group  (Yalom  &  Josselson,  2014).  Through  
feedback,  members  learn  to  view  themselves  through  others’  eyes,  and  they  learn  
the  ways  in  which  their  behavior  affects  others.  Building  on  what  members  learn  
about their interpersonal functioning in the group, they can take increased respon-
sibility  for  making  changes  in  everyday  life.  The  group  experience  provides  the  
opportunity to participants to relate to others in meaningful ways, to learn to be 
themselves in the company of other people, and to establish rewarding, nourishing 
relationships.
In existential group counseling, members come to terms with the paradoxes of 
existence:  that  life  can  be  undone  by  death,  that  success  is  precarious,  that  we  are  
determined to be free, that we are responsible for a world we did not choose, that we 
must make choices in the face of doubt and uncertainty. Members experience anxi-
ety  when  they  recognize  the  realities  of  the  human  condition,  including  pain  and  
suffering, the need to struggle for survival, and their basic fallibility. Clients learn 
that there are no ultimate answers for ultimate concerns. Through the support that 
is within a group, participants are able to tap the strength needed to create an inter-
nally derived value system that is consistent with their way of being.
A  group  provides  a  powerful  context  to  look  at  oneself,  and  to  consider  what  
choices  might  be  more  authentically  one’s  own.  Members  can  openly  share  their  
fears related to living in unfulfilling ways and come to recognize how they have com-
promised  their  integrity.  Members  can  gradually  discover  ways  in  which  they  have  
lost their direction and can begin to be more true to themselves. The group becomes 
a place where people can be together in deeply meaningful ways. Members learn that 
it is not in others that they find the answers to questions about significance and pur-
pose in life. Existential group leaders help members live in authentic ways and refrain

from prescribing simple solutions. For a more  detailed discussion of the existential 
approach to group counseling, see Corey (2016, chap. 9).
Existential Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Because the existential approach does not dictate a particular way of viewing 
or relating to reality, and because of its broad perspective, this approach is highly 
relevant  in  working  in  a  multicultural  context  (Deurzen,  2012).  Vontress  and  col-
leagues (1999) write about the existential foundation of cross-cultural counseling: 
“Existential  counseling  is  probably  the  most  useful  approach  to  helping  clients  
of  all  cultures  find  meaning  and  harmony  in  their  lives,  because  it  focuses  on  the  
sober  issues  each  of  us  must  inevitably  face:  love,  anxiety,  suffering,  and  death”   
(p. 32). These are the human experiences that transcend the boundaries that sepa-
rate cultures.
Existential therapy emphasizes presence, the I/Thou relationship, and courage. 
As such, it can be effectively applied with diverse client populations with a range of 
specific problems and in a wide array of settings (Schneider, 2008, 2011; Schneider 
& Krug, 2010). Schneider’s (2008) “existential-integrative” model of practice coordi-
nates a variety of therapeutic modes within an overarching existential or experiential 
framework. Vontress (2013) believes existential therapy is especially useful in work-
ing  with  culturally  diverse  populations  because  of  its  focus  on  universality,  or  the  
similarities we all share. He encourages counselors-in-training to focus on the univer-
sal commonalities of clients first and secondarily on areas of differences. In working 
with cultural diversity, it is essential to recognize how we are both alike and different.
The existential focus on subjective experience, or phenomenology, is a strength 
from  a  multicultural  perspective.  Another  strength  consists  of  inviting  clients  to  
examine  the  degree  to  which  their  behavior  is  being  influenced  by  social  and  cul-
tural conditioning. Clients can be challenged to look at the price they are paying for 
the decisions they have made. Although it is true that some clients may not feel a 
sense of freedom, their freedom can be increased if they recognize the social limits 
they are facing. Their freedom can be hindered by institutions and limited by their 
family. In fact, it may be difficult to separate individual freedom from the context 
of their family structure.
There is wide-ranging international interest in the existential approach. Several 
Scandinavian  societies,  an  East  European  society  (encompassing  Estonia,  Latvia,  
Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus), and Mexican and South American societ-
ies  are  thriving.  In  addition,  an  Internet  course,  SEPTIMUS,  is  taught  in  Ireland,  
Iceland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, Italy, Portugal, Austria, France, 
Belgium, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Australia. Most recently, the First Inter-
national  East-West  Existential  Psychology  conference  was  held  in  Nanjing,  China,  
with  representatives  from  the  United  States,  Korea,  and  Japan.  The  International  
Collaborative  of  Existential  Counsellors  and  Psychotherapists  (ICECAP)  meets

United Kingdom is thriving, and several doctoral programs are offered. These inter-
national developments confirm that existential therapy has wide appeal for diverse 
populations in many parts of the world.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
For  those  who  hold  a  systemic  perspective,  the  existentialists  can  be  criticized  on  
the  grounds  that  they  are  excessively  individualistic  and  ignore  the  social  factors  
that cause human problems. However, with the advent of the “existential-integrative” 
model of practice (Schneider, 2008), this situation is beginning to change. According 
to Schneider (2011), existential practitioners are not only concerned with facilitat-
ing  individual  change  but  with  promoting  an  in-depth  inquiry  that  has  implica-
tions  for  social  change:  “One  cannot  simply  heal  individuals  to  the  neglect  of  the  
social  context  within  which  they  are  thrust.  To  be  a  responsible  practitioner,  one  
must  develop  a  vision  of  responsible  social  change  alongside  and  in  coordination  
with one’s vision of individual transformation” (p. 281).
Some  individuals  who  seek  counseling  may  operate  on  the  assumption  that  
they  have  very  little  choice  because  environmental  circumstances  severely  restrict  
their ability to influence the direction of their lives. Even if they change internally, 
they see little hope that the external realities of racism, discrimination, and oppres-
sion will change. They are likely to experience a deep sense of frustration and feel-
ings of powerlessness when it comes to making changes outside of themselves. As 
you  will  see  in  Chapter  12,  feminist  therapists  maintain  that  therapeutic  practice  
will  be  effective  only  to  the  extent  that  therapists  intervene  with  some  form  of  
social  action  to  change  those  factors  that  are  creating  clients’  problems.  In  work-
ing  with  people  of  color  who  come  from  the  barrio  or  ghetto,  for  example,  it  is  
important to engage their survival issues. If a counselor too quickly puts across the  
message  to  these  clients  that  they  have  a  choice  in  making  their  lives  better,  they  
may feel patronized and misunderstood. These real-life concerns can provide a good 
focus for counseling, assuming the therapist is willing to deal with them.
A potential problem within existential theory is that it is highly focused on the 
philosophical assumption of self-determination, which may not take into account 
the complex factors that many people who have been oppressed must deal with. In 
many cultures it is not possible to talk about the self and self-determination apart 
from  the  context  of  the  social  network  and  environmental  conditions.  However,  a  
case  can  be  made  for  the  existential  approach  being  instrumental  in  enabling  cli-
ents to make conscious choices when it comes to the values they live by. Existential 
therapists do not push autonomy apart from a client’s culture. They do assist clients 
in  critically  evaluating  the  source  of  their  values  and  making  a  choice  rather  than  
uncritically accepting the values of their culture and family.
Many clients expect a structured and problem-oriented approach to counseling 
that  is  not  found  in  the  conventional  existential  approach.  Although  clients  may  
feel better if they have an opportunity to talk and to be understood, they are likely to 
expect the counselor to do something to bring about a change in their life situation. 
A  major  task  for  the  counselor  who  practices  from  an  existential  perspective  is  to  
provide enough concrete direction for these clients without taking the responsibil-
ity away from them.

A
s  an  existentially  oriented  therapist,  I  counsel  
Stan with the assumption that he has the capac-
ity to increase his self-awareness and decide for himself 
the  future  direction  of  his  life.  I  want  him  to  realize  
more  than  anything  else  that  he  does  not  have  to  be  
the victim of his past conditioning but can be the ar-
chitect  in  redesigning  his  future.  He  can  free  himself  
of  his  deterministic  shackles  and  accept  the  respon-
sibility  that  comes  with  directing  his  own  life.  This  
approach  emphasizes  the  importance  of  my  under-
standing of Stan’s world, primarily by establishing an 
authentic relationship as a means to a fuller degree of 
self-understanding.
Stan  is  demonstrating  what  Sartre  would  call  
“bad faith” by not accepting personal responsibility. I 
confront  Stan  with  the  ways  in  which  he  is  attempt-
ing  to  escape  from  his  freedom  through  alcohol  and  
drugs.  Eventually,  I  challenge  Stan’s  passivity.  I  reaf-
firm that he is now entirely responsible for his life, for 
his actions, and for his failure to take action. I do this 
in a supportive yet firm manner.
I  do  not  see  Stan’s  anxiety  as  something  nega-
tive, but as a vital part of living with uncertainty and 
freedom. Because there are no guarantees and because 
the  individual  is  ultimately  alone,  Stan  can  expect  to  
experience  some  degree  of  healthy  anxiety,  aloneness,  
guilt, and even despair. These conditions are not neu-
rotic in themselves, but the way in which Stan orients 
himself and copes with these conditions is critical.
Stan  sometimes  talks  about  his  suicidal  feelings.  
Certainly, I investigate further to determine if he poses 
an immediate threat to himself. In addition to this as-
sessment to determine lethality, I view his thoughts of 
“being  better  off  dead”  as  symbolic.  Could  it  be  that  
Stan feels he is dying as a person? Is Stan using his hu-
man potential? Is he choosing a way of merely existing 
instead of affirming life? Is Stan mainly trying to elicit 
sympathy from his family? I invite Stan to explore the 
meaning and purpose in his life. Is there any reason for 
him to want to continue living? What are some of the 
projects that enrich his life? What can he do to find a 
sense of purpose that will make him feel more signifi-
cant and alive?
Stan  needs  to  accept  the  reality  that  he  may  at  
times feel alone. Choosing for oneself and living from 
one’s own center accentuates the experience of alone-
ness. He is not, however, condemned to a life of isola-
tion, alienation from others, and loneliness. I hope to 
help Stan discover his own centeredness and live by the 
values he chooses and creates for himself. By doing so, 
Stan can become a more substantial person and come 
to appreciate himself more. When he does, the chances 
are lessened that he will have a need to secure approv-
al  from  others,  particularly  his  parents  and  parental  
substitutes.  Instead  of  forming  a  dependent  relation-
ship,  Stan  could  choose  to  relate  to  others  out  of  his  
strength.  Only  then  would  there  be  the  possibility  of  
overcoming his feelings of separateness and isolation.
Questions for Reflection
If Stan resisted your attempts to help him see that 
he is responsible for the direction of his life, how 
might you intervene?
Stan experiences a great deal of anxiety. From an 
existential perspective, how do you view his anxi-
ety? How might you work with his anxiety in help-
ful ways?
If Stan talks with you about suicide as a response 
to despair and a life without meaning, how would 
you respond?

I
n working with Gwen from an existential approach, 
I  want  to  be  a  witness  to  her  subjective  experience  
of  the  world  and  assist  her  in  exploring  powerful  life  
themes  such  as  meaning  making,  the  inevitability  of  
death,  freedom,  choice,  and  responsibility.  It  is  im-
portant  for  me  to  hear  and  understand  the  concerns  
Gwen  brings  to  this  session.  As  Gwen  walks  into  my  
office,  I  observe  her  rounded  shoulders  and  feel  the  
heaviness of her emotions.
Therapist: Tell me what you are experiencing 
[phenomenological inquiry].
Gwen:
 I feel overwhelmed, shut down, sad, 
and exhausted.
Therapist:
 The feelings you describe sound 
similar to your feelings when you first 
began counseling: numbness, feeling like 
your life is a flat note with little joy.
Gwen:
 Yes! I am tired of the violence. I am 
tired of young black men that look like 
my son losing their lives. This has got to 
stop. Something has to change in our 
country, and I don’t mean on the surface. 
Something has really got to change.
Therapist:
 I hear you.
Gwen: I can’t even sleep at night. I am trying 
not to watch the news because young 
people dying seems like an everyday 
occurrence. It’s not fair. Life cut short by 
ignorance and injustice. When I haven’t 
heard from my children in a while, I get a 
hole in the pit of my stomach. I am just sick 
thinking I will lose my child.
I  am  focused  on  being  present  for  Gwen  as  she  
grapples  with  these  challenging  existential  themes  
in  her  life.  I  listen  to  Gwen’s  personal  stories  of  rac-
ism  and  injustice  and  her  search  for  meaning.  She  
describes her anxiety as being like a fog that is always 
there  and  that  no  one  can  do  anything  about.  Her  
sense of helplessness and fear of death for her son is 
real.  I  assist  Gwen  in  seeing  that  she  has  options  in  
how she confronts experiences of injustice and unfair-
ness  as  they  occur  in  her  life.  As  Gwen  explores  and  
expresses  her  anxieties  and  fears,  she  begins  to  real-
ize she has the power and freedom to create meaning 
from  the  circumstances  that  arise  in  her  life.  Even  
those events and experiences that bring her pain can 
assist her in taking more control of her circumstances 
and living in a more vital manner.
Gwen: Worrying keeps me up much of 
the night. I end up feeling scared and 
depressed, and then I get into this whole 
spiral where everything feels wrong. Life is 
so fragile and can be cut short in a blink.
Therapist:
 It seems as though you have come 
to the realization that we are finite and that 
time is limited, and that’s frightening and 
anxiety producing.
Gwen:
 I feel helpless. I fear for my son’s life 
and feel like there is nothing I can do to 
protect him.
Therapist:
 With these intense feelings of 
helplessness, fear, and anxiety, how do you 
even get through your day?
Gwen:
 I have been through a lot and I 
have survived. Even though I have my 
fears, I surprise myself and bounce back 
eventually. At the end of the day, it’s my 
faith and the knowledge that I am making 
a difference in the world by passing my 
faith on to my children that helps me 
move forward.
As  an  existential  practitioner,  I  share  with  Gwen  
that  anxiety  is  a  natural  part  of  life  and  that  death  
awareness is a powerful force that can assist us in liv-
ing  a  fuller  existence.  In  our  awareness  of  our  own  
mortality, we can decide to take charge of our life and 
make choices that enhance our existence. Gwen begins 
to  see  that  her  experience  of  anxiety  may  be  a  key  to  
informing  her  of  exactly  how  she  might  begin  to  do  
things differently in her life.

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Existential  therapists  believe  we  all  are  capable  of  self-awareness,  which  is  the  dis-
tinctive  capacity  that  allows  us  to  reflect  and  to  decide.  With  this  awareness  we  
become free beings who are responsible for choosing the way we live, and we influ-
ence  our  own  destiny.  This  awareness  of  freedom  and  responsibility  gives  rise  to  
existential anxiety, which is another basic human characteristic. Whether we like it 
or not, we are free, even though we may seek to avoid reflecting on this freedom. The 
knowledge that we must choose, even though the outcome is not certain, leads to 
anxiety. This anxiety is heightened when we reflect on the reality that we are mortal. 
Facing the inevitable prospect of eventual death gives the present moment signifi-
cance, for we become aware that we do not have forever to accomplish our projects. 
As humans we are unique in that we strive toward fashioning purposes and values 
that  give  meaning  to  living.  Whatever  meaning  our  life  has  is  developed  through  
freedom and a commitment to make choices in the face of uncertainty.
Existential therapy places central prominence on the person-to-person relation-
ship. It assumes that client growth occurs through this genuine encounter. It is not 
the  techniques  a  therapist  uses  that  make  a  therapeutic  difference;  rather,  it  is  the  
quality  of  the  client–therapist  relationship  that  heals  (Elkins,  2016).  It  is  essential  
that therapists reach sufficient depth and openness in their own lives to allow them to 
venture into their clients’ subjective world without losing their own sense of identity. 
Presence  is  both  a  condition  for  therapy  to  occur  and  a  goal  of  therapy.  Existential  
therapists  strive  to  be  authentic  and  self-disclosing  in  their  therapy  work.  Because  
this  approach  focuses  on  the  goals  of  therapy,  basic  conditions  of  being  human,  
and therapy as a shared journey, practitioners are not bound by specific techniques. 
Although existential therapists may apply techniques from other orientations, their 
interventions  are  guided  by  a  philosophical  framework  about  what  it  means  to  be  
human.
As our session comes to a close, I remind Gwen of 
the powerful themes that surfaced in her session and 
her  ability  to  identify  as  a  strong,  spiritual,  resilient  
woman. I support her decision to journal more of her 
thoughts and feelings about what gives meaning and 
joy  to  her  life  and  how  she  can  make  a  difference  in  
these challenging times.
Questions for Reflection
What existential questions is Gwen facing  
in her life?
How would you experience being in the room 
with Gwen during this session? What may sur-
face for you as you sit with her?
How can awareness of the fragility of life be a cata-
lyst for making decisions about how to live more 
fully? Have you ever lost someone close to you? 
What decisions did you make?
Gwen has talked about her loneliness and isola-
tion, which are part of the human condition. 
How do you think an existential approach can 
help Gwen deal with this issue?

Contributions of the Existential Approach
The  existential  approach  has  helped  bring  the  person  back  into  central  
focus.  It  concentrates  on  the  central  facts  of  human  existence:  self-consciousness  
and  our  consequent  freedom.  To  the  existentialist  goes  the  credit  for  providing  a  
new view of death as a positive force, not a morbid prospect to fear, for death gives 
life meaning. Existentialists have contributed a new dimension to the understand-
ing of anxiety, guilt, frustration, loneliness, and alienation.
I  particularly  appreciate  the  way  Deurzen  (2012)  views  the  existential  practi-
tioner  as  a  mentor  and  fellow  traveler  who  encourages  people  to  reflect  upon  the  
problems they encounter in living. What clients need is “some assistance in survey-
ing the terrain and in deciding on the right route so that they can again find their 
way”  (p.  30).  The  existential  approach  encourages  people  to  live  life  by  their  own  
standards and values.
One  of  the  major  contributions  of  the  existential  approach  is  its  emphasis  on  
the human quality of the therapeutic relationship. This aspect lessens the chances of 
dehumanizing psychotherapy by making it a mechanical process. Existential coun-
selors reject the notions of therapeutic objectivity and professional distance, viewing 
them as being unhelpful.
I  very  much  value  the  existential  emphasis  on  freedom  and  responsibility  and  
the  person’s  capacity  to  redesign  his  or  her  life  by  choosing  with  awareness.  This  
perspective provides a sound philosophical base on which to build a personal and 
unique therapeutic style because it addresses itself to the core struggles of the con-
temporary person.
Contributions to the Integration of Psychotherapies From my perspective, the 
key  concepts  of  the  existential  approach  can  be  integrated  into  most  therapeutic  
schools. Regardless of a therapist’s orientation, the foundation for practice can be 
based on existential themes. Existential psychotherapy continues to have an enduring 
impact on a variety of psychological practices. “Indeed, existential psychotherapy is 
in the ironic position of being one of the most widely influential yet least officially 
embraced orientations on the professional scene” (Schneider, 2008, p. 1).
A  key  contribution  is  the  possibility  of  a  creative  integration  of  the  concep-
tual  propositions  of  existential  therapy  with  many  other  therapeutic  orientations  
(Bugental  &  Bracke,  1992;  Schneider,  2008,  2011;  Schneider  &  Krug,  2010).  One  
example of such a creative integration is provided by Dattilio (2002), who integrates 
cognitive  behavioral  techniques  with  the  themes  of  an  existential  approach.  As  a  
cognitive behavior therapist and author, Dattilio maintains that he directs much of 
his efforts to “helping clients make a deep existential shift—to a new understanding 
of  the  world”  (p.  75).  He  uses  techniques  such  as  restructuring  of  belief  systems,  
relaxation methods, and a variety of cognitive and behavioral strategies, but he does 
so  within  an  existential  framework  that  can  begin  the  process  of  real-life  transfor-
mation. Many of his clients suffer from panic attacks or depression. Dattilio often 
explores with these people existential themes of meaning, guilt, hopelessness, anxi-
ety—and at the same time he provides them with cognitive behavioral tools to cope 
with the problems of daily living. In short, he grounds symptomatic treatment in an 
existential approach.

EXISTEnTIAl THERAPy         159 
Some  people  have  argued  that  the  new  trend  toward  positive  psychology  is  
similar  to  the  existential  approach,  but  this  rests  on  a  superficial  comparison  of  
these  two  approaches.  Existential  therapists  favor  intensity  and  passionate  experi-
ence, including that of happiness, but they equally value the darker side of human 
nature and would encourage clients to learn to value both sides of their experience 
(Deurzen, 2009).
Limitations and Criticisms of the Existential Approach
A  major  criticism  often  aimed  at  this  approach  is  that  it  lacks  a  systematic  state-
ment  of  the  principles  and  practices  of  psychotherapy.  Some  practitioners  have  
trouble with what they perceive as its mystical language and concepts. Some thera-
pists  who  claim  adherence  to  an  existential  orientation  describe  their  therapeutic  
style in vague and global terms such as self-actualization, dialogic encounter, authenticity, 
and being in the world. This particular use of language causes confusion at times and 
makes  it  difficult  to  conduct  research  on  the  process  or  outcomes  of  existential  
therapy.
Both beginning and advanced practitioners who are not of a philosophical turn 
of mind tend to find many of the existential concepts lofty and elusive. As we have 
seen, this approach places primary emphasis on a subjective understanding of the 
world of clients. It is assumed that techniques follow understanding. The fact that 
few techniques are generated by this approach makes it essential for practitioners to 
develop their own innovative procedures or to borrow from other schools of therapy. 
For  counselors  who  believe  they  need  a  specific  set  of  techniques  to  counsel  effec-
tively, this approach has limitations (Vontress, 2013).
Practitioners who prefer a counseling practice based on research contend that 
the  concepts  should  be  empirically  sound,  that  definitions  should  be  operational,  
that  the  hypotheses  should  be  testable,  and  that  therapeutic  practice  should  be  
based on the results of research into both the process and outcomes of counseling. 
Certainly,  the  notions  of  manualized  therapy  and  evidence-based  practice  are  not  
part of the existential perspective because every psychotherapy experience is unique 
(Walsh  &  McElwain,  2002).  According  to  Cooper  (2003),  existential  practitioners  
generally  reject  the  idea  that  the  therapeutic  process  can  be  measured  and  evalu-
ated in quantitative and empirical ways. Although existential practices are generally 
upheld in recent research on therapeutic effectiveness (see Elkins, 2009), few studies 
directly evaluate and examine the existential approach. To a large extent, existential 
therapy  makes  use  of  techniques  from  other  theories,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  
apply research to thiss approach to study its effectiveness (Sharf, 2016).
According  to  Deurzen  (2002),  the  main  limitation  of  this  approach  is  that  of  
the level of maturity, life experience, and intensive training required of practitioners. 
Existential  therapists  need  to  be  wise  and  capable  of  profound  and  wide-ranging  
understanding of what it means to be human. Authenticity is a cardinal character-
istic of a competent existential practitioner, which is certainly more involved than 
mastering  a  body  of  knowledge  and  acquiring  technical  skills.  Russell  (2007)  puts  
this notion nicely: “Authenticity means being able to sign your own name on your 
work  and  your  life.  It  means  you  will  want  to  take  responsibility  for  creating  your  
own way of being a therapist” (p. 123).

Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. Identify at least one turning point in your life. What decision did  
you make at this time, and how has this influenced the person you  
are today?
2. What does existential anxiety mean to you? How do you deal with this 
kind of anxiety in your life?
3.
 Existential therapy provides a philosophy and a framework for psycho-
therapy, but few techniques. How can you have an existential orienta-
tion and at the same time incorporate techniques from other therapy 
models?
4.
 Existential themes have relevance for working with a range of clients 
with a variety of problems in various settings. What one existential 
theme do you believe is a key issue for many people today?
5.
 How would you work with a client who has little interest in exploring 
existential themes and asks for advice on how to deal with some con-
crete problem?
Where to Go From Here
Refer to the DVD for Integrative Counseling: The Case of Ruth and Lecturettes, Session 11 
(“Understanding How the Past Influences the Present and the Future”), for a dem-
onstration of ways I utilize existential notions in counseling Ruth. We engage in a 
role play where Ruth becomes the voice of her church and I take on a new role as 
Ruth—one  in  which  I  have  been  willing  to  challenge  certain  beliefs  from  church.  
This  segment  illustrates  how  I  assist  Ruth  in  finding  new  values.  In  Session  12  
(“Working  Toward  Decisions  and  Behavioral  Changes”)  I  challenge  Ruth  to  make  
new decisions, which is also an existential concept.

Recommended Supplementary Readings
Everyday  Mysteries:  A  Handbook  of  Existential  Psycho-
therapy  (Deurzen,  2010)  provides  a  framework  for  
practicing  counseling  from  an  existential  perspec-
tive.  The  author  puts  into  clear  perspective  topics  
such  as  anxiety,  authentic  living,  clarifying  one’s  
worldview,  determining  values,  discovering  mean-
ing, and coming to terms with life.
Existential  Counselling  and  Psychotherapy  in  Practice 
(Deurzen,  2012)  offers  an  excellent  presentation  of  
the theory and practice of existential therapy based 
on  the  European  tradition.  The  author  provides  a  
framework for addressing problems in living rather 
than techniques for working with clients.
Skills   in   Existential   Counselling   and   Psychotherapy 
(Deurzen  &  Adams,  2011)  is  a  clearly  written  book  
that   explains   the   existential   attitude,   highlights   
the  importance  of  the  person  of  the  therapist,  and  
describes  the  process  of  existential  therapy.  This  is  
a  superb  resource  that  provides  a  basis  for  under-
standing how to apply existential notions to thera-
peutic practice.
Existential  Therapies  (Cooper,  2003)  provides  a  use-
ful  and  clear  introduction  to  the  existential  thera-
pies. There are separate chapters on logotherapy, the 
British  school  of  existential  analysis,  the  American  
existential-humanistic   approach,   dimensions   of   
existential therapeutic practice, and brief existential 
therapies.
Existential  Psychotherapy  (Yalom,  1980)  is  a  superb  
treatment of the ultimate human concerns of death, 
freedom,  isolation,  and  meaninglessness  as  these  
issues  relate  to  therapy.  This  book  has  depth  and  
clarity, and it is rich with clinical examples that illus-
trate existential themes.
Existential-Humanistic  Therapy  (Schneider  &  Krug,  
2010)  is  a  clear  presentation  of  the  theory  and  
practice   of   existential-humanistic   therapy.   This   
approach  incorporates  techniques  from  other  con-
temporary therapeutic approaches.
Existential-Integrative  Psychotherapy:  Guideposts  to  the  
Core  of  Practice  (Schneider,  2008)  is  an  edited  book  
that  offers  recent  and  future  trends  in  existential-
integrative  therapy  and  case  illustrations  of  this  
model.
I Never Knew I Had a Choice (Corey & Corey, 2014) is 
a self-help book written from an existential perspec-
tive.  Topics  include  our  struggle  to  achieve  auton-
omy; the meaning of loneliness, death, and loss; and 
how we choose our values and philosophy of life.

CARL  ROGERS  (1902–1987),  a  major  
spokesperson   for   humanistic   psychol-
ogy,  led  a  life  that  reflected  the  ideas  he  
developed  for  half  a  century.  He  showed  
a  questioning  stance,  a  deep  openness  
to  change,  and  the  courage  to  forge  into  
unknown territory both as a person and as 
a professional. In writing about his early 
years,  Rogers  (1961)  recalled  his  fam-
ily  atmosphere  as  characterized  by  close  
and warm relationships but also by strict 
religious standards. Play was discouraged, 
and  the  virtues  of  the  Protestant  ethic  
were  extolled.  His  boyhood  was  somewhat  lonely,  and  
he  pursued  scholarly  interests  instead  of  social  ones.  
Rogers was an introverted person, and he spent a lot of 
time  reading  and  engaging  in  imaginative  activity  and  
reflection.  During  his  college  years  his  interests  and  
academic  major  changed  from  agriculture  to  history,  
then to religion, and finally to clinical psychology.
Rogers  held  academic  positions  in  various  fields,  
including  education,  social  work,  counseling,  psycho-
therapy,  group  therapy,  peace,  and  interpersonal  rela-
tions, and he earned recognition around the world for 
originating and developing the humanistic movement 
in  psychotherapy.  His  foundational  ideas,  especially  
the central role of the client–therapist relationship as a 
means  to  growth  and  change,  have  been  incorporated  
in  many  other  theoretical  approaches.  Rogers’s  ideas  
continue to have far-reaching effects on the field of psy-
chotherapy (Cain, 2010).
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of 
Rogers’s  contributions  to  clinical  and  counseling  
psychology.  He  was  a  courageous  pioneer  
who  “was  about  50  years  ahead  of  his  
time and has been waiting for us to catch 
up” (Elkins, 2009, p. 20). Often called the 
“father of psychotherapy research,” Rogers 
was  the  first  to  study  the  counseling  pro-
cess  in  depth  by  analyzing  the  transcripts  
of  actual  therapy  sessions,  and  he  was  
the  first  clinician  to  conduct  major  stud-
ies  on  psychotherapy  using  quantitative  
methods.  He  was  the  first  to  formulate  a  
comprehensive  theory  of  personality  and  
psychotherapy    grounded    in    empirical    
research, and he contributed to developing a theory 
of psychotherapy that focused on the strengths and 
resources  of  individuals.  He  was  not  afraid  to  take  
a  strong  position  and  challenged  the  status  quo  
throughout his professional career.
During the last 15 years of his life, Rogers applied 
the person-centered approach to world peace by train-
ing   policymakers,   leaders,   and   groups   in   conflict.   
Perhaps  his  greatest  passion  was  directed  toward  the  
reduction  of  interracial  tensions  and  the  effort  to  
achieve  world  peace,  for  which  he  was  nominated  for  
the Nobel Peace Prize.
For a detailed video presentation of the life and 
works  of  Carl  Rogers,  see  Carl  Rogers:  A  Daughter’s  
Tribute (N. Rogers, 2002), which is described at the 
end  of  this  chapter.  For  an  in-depth  look  at  this  
remarkable man and his work, see Carl Rogers: The 
Quiet  Revolutionary  (Rogers  &  Russell,  2002)  and  
The  Life  and  Work  of  Carl  Rogers  (Kirschenbaum,  
2009).
NATALIE  ROGERS  (b.  1928)  is  a  pioneer  
in  the  field  of  person-centered  expres-
sive  arts  therapy.  She  expanded  on  her  
father’s   (Carl   Rogers)   theory   of   cre-
ativity  by  using  the  expressive  arts  to  
enhance  personal  growth  for  individuals  
and   groups.   Person-centered   expres-
sive  arts  therapy  employs  a  variety  of  
forms—movement,  painting,  sculpting,  
music,  writing,  and  improvisation—in  a  
supportive   setting   to   facilitate   growth   
and  healing.  It  extends  person-centered  
theory by helping individuals access their 
feelings   through   creative   expressions.   
N.  Rogers  has  developed  the  concept  of  
the creative   connection
®
—a   process   
whereby  the  client  or  group  member  is  
invited  to  access  inner  feelings  through  
an uninterrupted sequence of movement, 
sound, visual art, and journal writing. As 
the  client  moves  through  this  process,  
hidden or unconscious aspects of self are 
discovered,  and  these  insights  are  shared  
with the therapist.

166            CHAPTER SEVEN 
Four Periods of Development of the Approach
In  tracing  the  major  turning  points  in  Rogers’s  approach,  Zimring  and  
Raskin (1992) and Bozarth, Zimring, and Tausch (2002) have identified four periods 
of  development.  In  the  first  period,  during  the  1940s,  Rogers  developed  what  was  
known as nondirective counseling, which provided a powerful and revolutionary alter-
native to the directive and interpretive approaches to therapy then being practiced. 
While he was a professor at Ohio State University, Rogers (1942) published Counsel-
ing and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in Practice, which described the philosophy and 
practice  of  nondirective  counseling.  Rogers’s  theory  emphasized  the  counselor’s  
creation  of  a  permissive  and  nondirective  climate.  When  he  challenged  the  basic  
assumption  that  “the  counselor  knows  best,”  he  realized  this  radical  idea  would  
affect the power dynamics and politics of the counseling profession, and indeed it 
caused a great furor (Elkins, 2009).
Rogers  also  challenged  the  validity  of  commonly  accepted  therapeutic  proce-
dures  such  as  advice,  suggestion,  direction,  persuasion,  teaching,  diagnosis,  and  
interpretation.  Based  on  his  conviction  that  diagnostic  concepts  and  procedures  
were  inadequate,  prejudicial,  and  often  misused,  Rogers  omitted  them  from  his  
approach.  Nondirective  counselors  avoided  sharing  a  great  deal  about  themselves  
with clients and instead focused mainly on reflecting and clarifying the clients’ ver-
bal communications and intended meanings.
In  the  second  period,  during  the  1950s,  Rogers  (1951)  renamed  his  approach  
client-centered therapy, which reflected his emphasis on the client rather than on non-
directive methods. In addition, he started the Counseling Center at the University 
of Chicago. This period was characterized by a shift from clarification of feelings to 
a focus on the phenomenological world of the client. Rogers assumed that the best 
vantage  point  for  understanding  how  people  behave  was  from  their  own  internal  
frame  of  reference.  He  focused  more  explicitly  on  the  actualizing  tendency  as  the  
basic motivational force that leads to client change.
The  third  period,  which  began  in  the  late  1950s  and  extended  into  the  1970s,  
addressed the necessary and sufficient conditions of therapy. Rogers (1957) set forth 
a hypothesis that resulted in three decades of research. A significant publication was 
On  Becoming  a  Person  (C.  Rogers,  1961),  which  addressed  the  nature  of  “becoming  
the self that one truly is,” an idea he borrowed from Kierkegaard. Rogers published 
this  work  during  the  time  that  he  held  joint  appointments  in  the  departments  of  
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin. In this book he described 
the process of “becoming one’s experience,” which is characterized by an openness 
to  experience,  a  trust  in  one’s  experience,  an  internal  locus  of  evaluation,  and  the  
willingness to be in process. During the 1950s and 1960s, Rogers and his associates 
continued to test the underlying hypotheses of the client-centered approach by con-
ducting extensive research on both the process and the outcomes of psychotherapy. 
He  was  interested  in  how  people  best  progress  in  psychotherapy,  and  he  studied  
the qualities of the client–therapist relationship as a catalyst leading to personality 
change.
Rogers  and  his  associates  at  the  University  of  Chicago  conducted  research  to  
identify the ingredients in psychotherapy that account for therapeutic change. The 
client-centered  approach  emphasized  the  role  of  the  therapist  as  a  facilitator  of

growth and honored the inherent power of the client. Research findings consistently 
supported this approach, confirming that therapeutic change is due to personal and 
interpersonal factors rather than to specific techniques for curing specific disorders 
(Elkins, 2016). On the basis of this research, the approach was further refined and 
expanded (C. Rogers, 1961). For example, client-centered philosophy was applied to 
education and was called student-centered teaching (C. Rogers & Freiberg, 1994). The 
approach was also applied to encounter groups (C. Rogers, 1970).
The fourth phase, during the 1980s and the 1990s, was marked by considerable 
expansion to education, couples and families, industry, groups, conflict resolution, 
politics, and the search for world peace. Because of Rogers’s ever-widening scope of 
influence, including his interest in how people obtain, possess, share, or surrender 
power and control over others and themselves, his theory became known as the per-
son-centered approach. This shift in terms reflected the broadening application of the 
approach. Although the person-centered approach has been applied mainly to indi-
vidual and group counseling, important areas of further application include educa-
tion, family life, leadership and administration, organizational development, health 
care, cross-cultural and interracial activity, and international relations. During the 
1980s Rogers directed his efforts toward applying the person-centered approach to 
politics, especially to efforts related to the achievement of world peace.
In  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  research  on  person-centered  therapy  over  a  
period of 60 years, Bozarth, Zimring, and Tausch (2002) concluded the following:
In the earliest years of the approach, the client rather than the therapist 
determined the direction and goals of therapy and the therapist’s role 
was to help the client clarify feelings. This style of nondirective therapy 
was associated with increased understanding, greater self-exploration, 
and improved self-concepts.
Later a shift from clarification of feelings to a focus on the client’s lived 
experiences took place.
As person-centered therapy developed further, research centered on 
the core conditions assumed to be both necessary and sufficient for 
successful therapy. The attitude of the therapist—an empathic under-
standing of the client’s world and the ability to communicate a non-
judgmental stance to the client—along with the therapist’s genuineness 
were found to be basic to a successful therapy outcome.
The main source of successful psychotherapy is the client. The therapist’s 
attention to the client’s frame of reference fosters the client’s utilization

emotion-focused  therapy  (eFt)  emerged  as  a  person-centered  “approach  
informed by understanding the role of emotion in human functioning and psycho-
therapeutic  change”  (Greenberg,  2014,  p.  15).  Leslie  Greenberg,  a  prominent  figure  
in the development of this integrative approach, states that EFT is designed to help 
clients increase their awareness of their emotions and make productive use of them. 
Like  person-centered  therapists,  emotion-focused  therapists  establish  a  therapeutic

relationship based on the core therapeutic conditions. Once the therapeutic alliance 
is created, however, the EFT practitioner actively works with emotions using a range 
of experiential techniques to strengthen the self, regulate affect, and create new mean-
ing. New narratives can be created that disrupt maladaptive past emotional schemas, 
which provides opportunities for positive emotional experiencing (McDonald, 2015).
EFT strategies focus on two major tasks: (1) help clients with too little emotion 
access their emotions, and (2) help clients who experience too much emotion con-
tain their emotions (Greenberg, 2014). Many traditional therapies emphasize con-
scious understanding and cognitive and behavioral change, but they often neglect 
the foundational role of emotional change. A main goal of EFT is to help individuals 
access  and  process  emotions  to  construct  new  ways  of  being.  This  approach  has  a  
good  deal  to  offer  with  respect  to  teaching  us  about  the  role  of  emotion  in  per-
sonal change and how emotional change can be a primary pathway to cognitive and 
behavioral change (Greenberg, 2014).
EFT  emphasizes  the  importance  of  awareness,  acceptance,  and  understanding  
the  visceral  experience  of  emotion.  Greenberg  (2014)  believes  that  our  emotions  
cannot be change merely by talking about them, understanding their origins, or by 
modifying our beliefs. Clients are encouraged to identify, experience, accept, express, 
explore, transform, and manage their emotions. The act of experiencing feelings and 
replacing old feelings with new positive feelings offers a corrective emotional expe-
rience.  “One  changes  emotions  by  accepting  and  experiencing  them,  by  opposing  
them with different emotions to transform them, and by reflecting on them to cre-
ate new narrative meaning” (p. 18).
Both psychoanalytic and cognitive behavioral approaches are increasingly focus-
ing on emotions and are rapidly assimilating many aspects of EFT. Gestalt therapy 
has  always  emphasized  experiencing  and  exploring  emotions.  McDonald  (2015)  
reports that a strength of EFT is that it is an empirically validated brief therapeutic 
approach with demonstrated effectiveness in treating anxiety, intimate partner vio-
lence, eating disorders, and trauma. EFT is being applied to counseling individuals, 
groups, couples, families, and in working in diverse cultural contexts.
The theory and practice of EFT are only briefly discussed in this chapter. For an 
in-depth discussion of the principles and techniques involved in the practice of EFT, 
see Greenberg (2011), Emotion-Focused Therapy.
Existentialism and Humanism
In the 1960s and 1970s there was a growing interest among counselors in a “third 
force” in therapy as an alternative to the psychoanalytic and behavioral approaches. 
Under  this  heading  fall  existential  therapy  (Chapter  6),  person-centered  therapy  
(Chapter  7),  Gestalt  therapy  (Chapter  8),  and  certain  other  experiential  and  rela-
tionship-oriented approaches.
The  connections  between  the  terms  existentialism  and  humanism  have  tended  
to be confusing for students and theorists alike. The two viewpoints have much in 
common, yet there also are significant philosophical differences between them. They 
share a respect for the client’s subjective experience, the uniqueness and individual-
ity of each client, and a trust in the capacity of the client to make positive and con-
structive conscious choices. They have in common an emphasis on concepts such as

freedom, choice, values, personal responsibility, autonomy, purpose, and meaning. 
Both approaches place little value on the role of techniques in the therapeutic pro-
cess and emphasize instead the importance of genuine encounter.
They  differ  in  that  existentialists  take  the  position  that  we  are  faced  with  the  
anxiety  of  choosing  to  create  an  identity  in  a  world  that  lacks  intrinsic  meaning.  
Existentialists  tend  to  acknowledge  the  stark  realities  of  human  experience,  and  
their  writings  often  focus  on  death,  anxiety,  meaninglessness,  and  isolation.  The  
humanists, in contrast, take the somewhat less anxiety-evoking and more optimistic 
view that each of us has a natural potential that we can actualize and through which 
we can find meaning. Many contemporary existential therapists refer to themselves 
as existential-humanistic  practitioners,  indicating  that  their  roots  are  in  existential  
philosophy  but  that  they  have  incorporated  many  aspects  of  North  American  
humanistic psychotherapies (Cain, 2002a; Schneider & Krug, 2010).
As  will  become  evident  in  this  chapter,  the  existential  and  person-centered  
approaches  have  parallel  concepts  with  regard  to  the  client–therapist  relationship  
being at the core of therapy. The phenomenological emphasis that is basic to the exis-
tentialist approach is also fundamental to person-centered theory. Both approaches 
focus on the client’s perceptions and call for the therapist to be fully present with the 
client so that it is possible to understand the client’s subjective world, and they both 
emphasize the client’s capacity for self-awareness and self-healing. The therapist aims 
to provide the client with a safe, responsive, and caring relationship to facilitate self-
exploration, growth, and healing (Watson, Goldman, & Greenberg, 2011).
Abraham Maslow’s Contributions to Humanistic Psychology
Abraham  Maslow  (1970)  was  a  pioneer  in  the  development  of  humanistic  
psychology and was influential in furthering the understanding of self-actualizing 
individuals. Many of Carl Rogers’s ideas, especially on the positive aspects of being 
human and the fully functioning person, are influenced by Maslow’s basic philoso-
phy.  Maslow  criticized  Freudian  psychology  for  what  he  saw  as  its  preoccupation  
with the sick and dark side of human nature. Maslow believed too much research 
was being conducted on anxiety, hostility, and neuroses and too little into joy, cre-
ativity,  and  self-fulfillment.  Self-actualization  was  the  central  theme  of  the  work  
of  Abraham  Maslow  (1968,  1970,  1971).  The  positive  psychology  movement  that  
recently  has  come  into  prominence  shares  many  concepts  on  the  healthy  side  of  
human existence with the humanistic approach.
Maslow studied what he called “self-actualizing people” and found that they dif-
fered in important ways from so-called normal individuals. The core characteristics of 
self-actualizing people are self-awareness, freedom, basic honesty and caring, and trust 
and autonomy. Other characteristics of self-actualizing individuals include a capacity 
to welcome uncertainty in their lives, acceptance of themselves and others, spontane-
ity and creativity, a need for privacy and solitude, autonomy, a capacity for deep and 
intense interpersonal relationships, a genuine caring for others, an inner-directedness 
(as  opposed  to  the  tendency  to  live  by  others’  expectations),  the  absence  of  artificial  
dichotomies within themselves (such as work/play, love/hate, and weak/strong), and 
a sense of humor (Maslow, 1970). All of these personal characteristics are compatible 
with the person-centered philosophy.

Maslow postulated a hierarchy of needs as a source of motivation, with the most 
basic needs being physiological needs. If we are hungry and thirsty, our attention is 
riveted on meeting these basic needs. Next are the safety needs, which include a sense 
of security and stability. Once our physical and safety needs are fulfilled, we become 
concerned with meeting our needs for belonging and love, followed by our need for 
esteem,  both  from  self  and  others.  We  are  able  to  strive  toward  self-actualization  
only after these four basic needs are met. The key factor determining which need is 
dominant at a given time is the degree to which those below it are satisfied.
The  Vision  of  Humanistic  Philosophy  The  underlying  vision  of  humanistic  
philosophy  is  captured  by  the  metaphor  of  how  an  acorn,  if  provided  with  the  
appropriate   conditions,   will   “automatically”   grow   in   positive   ways,   pushed   
naturally  toward  its  actualization  as  an  oak.  In  contrast,  for  many  existentialists  
there is nothing that we “are,” no internal “nature” we can count on. We are faced 
at  every  moment  with  a  choice  about  what  to  make  of  this  condition.  Maslow’s  
emphasis on the healthy side of being human and the emphasis on joy, creativity, 
and  self-fulfillment  are  part  of  the  person-centered  philosophy.  The  humanistic  
philosophy  on  which  the  person-centered  approach  rests  is  expressed  in  attitudes  
and behaviors that create a growth-producing climate. According to Rogers (1986b), 
when this philosophy is lived, it helps people develop their capacities and stimulates 
constructive change in others. Individuals are empowered, and they are able to use 
this power for personal and social transformation.
Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
A common theme originating in Rogers’s early writing and continuing to permeate 
all of his works is a basic sense of trust in the client’s ability to move forward in a 
constructive  manner  if  conditions  fostering  growth  are  present.  His  professional  
experience taught him that if one is able to get to the core of an individual, one finds 
a  trustworthy,  positive  center  (C.  Rogers,  1987a).  In  keeping  with  the  philosophy  
of  humanistic  psychology,  Rogers  firmly  maintained  that  people  are  trustworthy,  
resourceful, capable of self-understanding and self-direction, able to make construc-
tive changes, and able to live effective and productive lives. When therapists are able 
to experience and communicate their realness, support, caring, and nonjudgmental 
understanding, significant changes in the client are most likely to occur.
Rogers  maintained  that  three  therapist  attributes  create  a  growth-promoting  
climate in which individuals can move forward and become what they are capable 
of becoming: (1) congruence (genuineness, or realness), (2) unconditional positive regard 
(acceptance and caring), and (3) accurate empathic understanding (an ability to deeply 
grasp  the  subjective  world  of  another  person).  According  to  Rogers,  if  therapists  
communicate  these  attitudes,  those  being  helped  will  become  less  defensive  and  
more open to themselves and their world, and they will behave in prosocial and con-
structive ways.
The actualizing tendency is a directional process of striving toward realization, 
fulfillment,  autonomy,  and  self-determination.  This  natural  inclination  of  humans

is  based  on  Maslow’s  (1970)  studies  of  self-actualizing  people,  and  it  has  significant  
implications for the practice of therapy. Because of the belief that the individual has an 
inherent capacity to move away from maladjustment and toward psychological health 
and growth, the therapist places the primary responsibility on the client. The person-
centered  approach  rejects  the  role  of  the  therapist  as  the  authority  who  knows  best  
and of the passive client who depends on the therapist’s expertise. Therapy is rooted in 
the client’s capacity for awareness and self-directed change in attitudes and behavior.
The person-centered approach emphasizes clients’ abilities to engage their own 
resources to act in their world with others. Clients can move forward in constructive 
directions  and  successfully  deal  with  obstacles  (both  from  within  themselves  and  
outside of themselves) that are blocking their growth. By promoting self-awareness 
and self-reflection, clients learn to exercise choice. Humanistic therapists emphasize 
a  discovery-oriented  approach  in  which  clients  are  the  experts  on  their  own  inner  
experience  (Watson  et  al.,  2011),  and  they  encourage  clients  to  make  changes  that  
will lead to living fully and authentically, with the realization that this kind of exis-
tence demands a continuing struggle.
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
Rogers did not believe the goal of therapy was merely to solve problems. Rather, the 
goal  is  to  assist  clients  in  achieving  a  greater  degree  of  independence  and  integra-
tion so they can better cope with problems as they identify them. Before clients are 
able to work toward that goal, they must first get behind the masks they wear, which 
they  develop  through  the  process  of  socialization.  Clients  come  to  recognize  that  
they have lost contact with themselves by using facades. In a climate of safety in the 
therapeutic session, they also come to realize that there are more authentic ways of 
being. The therapist does not choose specific goals for the client. The cornerstone 
of person-centered theory is the view that clients in a relationship with a facilitating 
therapist  have  the  capacity  to  define  and  clarify  their  own  goals.  Person-centered  
therapists are in agreement on the matter of not setting goals for what clients need 
to change, yet they differ on the matter of how to best help clients achieve their own 
goals and to find their own answers (Bohart & Watson, 2011).
Therapist’s Function and Role
The  role  of  person-centered  therapists  is  rooted  in  their  ways  of  being  and  
attitudes, not in techniques designed to get the client to “do something.” Research 
on  person-centered  therapy  indicates  that  the  attitude  of  therapists,  rather  than  
their  knowledge,  theories,  or  techniques,  facilitate  personality  change  in  clients  
(C. Rogers, 1961). Basically, therapists use themselves as an instrument of change by 
encountering clients on a person-to-person level. In examining the human elements 
of  psychotherapy,  Elkins  (2016)  concludes  that  the  human  dimensions  are  more  
powerful determinants of therapeutic effectiveness than theories or techniques. It is 
the therapist’s attitude and belief in the inner resources of the client that creates the 
therapeutic climate for growth (Bozarth et al., 2002).

Person-centered theory holds that the therapist’s function is to be present and 
accessible to clients and to focus on their immediate experience. First and foremost, 
the  therapist  must  be  willing  to  be  real  in  the  relationship  with  clients.  By  being  
congruent, accepting, and empathic, the therapist is a catalyst for change. Instead of 
viewing clients in preconceived diagnostic categories, the therapist meets them on 
a moment-to-moment experiential basis and enters their world. Through the thera-
pist’s attitude of genuine caring, respect, acceptance, support, and understanding, 
clients are able to loosen their defenses and rigid perceptions and move to a higher 
level  of  personal  functioning.  When  these  therapist  attitudes  are  present,  clients  
then have the necessary freedom to explore areas of their life that were either denied 
to awareness or distorted.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
Therapeutic  change  depends  on  clients’  perceptions  both  of  their  own  experience  
in therapy and of the counselor’s basic attitudes. If the counselor creates a climate 
conducive to self-exploration, clients have the opportunity to explore the full range 
of their experience, which includes their feelings, beliefs, behavior, and worldview. 
What follows is a general sketch of clients’ experiences in therapy.
Clients come to the counselor in a state of incongruence; that is, a discrepancy 
exists between their self-perception and their experience in reality. For example, Leon, 
a college student, may see himself as a future physician, yet his below-average grades 
could  exclude  him  from  medical  school.  The  discrepancy  between  how  Leon  sees  
himself (self-concept) or how he would like to view himself (ideal self-concept) and 
the reality of his poor academic performance may result in anxiety and personal vul-
nerability, which can provide the necessary motivation to enter therapy. Leon must 
perceive that a problem exists or, at least, that he is uncomfortable enough with his 
present psychological adjustment to want to explore possibilities for change.
One reason clients seek therapy is a feeling of basic helplessness, powerlessness, 
and  an  inability  to  make  decisions  or  effectively  direct  their  own  lives.  They  may  
hope  to  find  “the  way”  through  the  guidance  of  the  therapist.  Within  the  person-
centered  framework,  however,  clients  soon  learn  that  they  can  be  responsible  for  
themselves in the relationship and that they can learn to be more free by using the 
relationship to gain greater self-understanding.
As counseling progresses, clients are able to explore a wider range of beliefs and 
feelings. They can express their fears, anxiety, guilt, shame, hatred, anger, and other 
emotions  that  they  had  deemed  too  negative  to  accept  and  incorporate  into  their  
self-structure.  With  therapy,  people  distort  less  and  move  to  a  greater  acceptance  
and  integration  of  conflicting  and  confusing  feelings.  They  increasingly  discover  
aspects  within  themselves  that  had  been  kept  hidden.  As  clients  feel  understood  
and accepted, they become less defensive and become more open to their experience. 
Because they feel safer and are less vulnerable, they become more realistic, perceive 
others with greater accuracy, and become better able to understand and accept oth-
ers. Individuals in therapy come to appreciate themselves more as they are, and their 
behavior  shows  more  flexibility  and  creativity.  They  become  less  concerned  about  
meeting  others’  expectations,  and  thus  begin  to  behave  in  ways  that  are  truer  to  
themselves.  These  individuals  direct  their  own  lives  instead  of  looking  outside  of

themselves  for  answers.  They  move  in  the  direction  of  being  more  in  contact  with  
what they are experiencing at the present moment, less bound by the past, less deter-
mined, freer to make decisions, and increasingly trusting in themselves to manage 
their  own  lives.  In  short,  their  experience  in  therapy  is  like  throwing  off  the  self-
imposed shackles that had kept them in a psychological prison. With increased free-
dom, they tend to become more mature psychologically and move toward increased 
self-actualization.
Person-centered therapy is grounded on the assumption that clients create their 
own self-growth and are active self-healers (Bohart & Tallman, 1999, 2010; Bohart & 
Wade, 2013; Bohart & Watson, 2011). The therapy relationship provides a support-
ive structure within which clients’ self-healing capacities are activated. What clients 
value most is being understood and accepted, which results in creating a safe place 
to explore feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and experiences; clients also value support 
for trying out new behaviors (Bohart & Tallman, 2010).
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Rogers  (1957)  based  his  hypothesis  of  the  “necessary  and  sufficient  condi-
tions for therapeutic personality change” on the quality of the relationship: “If I can 
provide a certain type of relationship, the other person will discover within himself 
or herself the capacity to use that relationship for growth and change, and personal 
development  will  occur”  (C.  Rogers,  1961,  p.  33).  Rogers  (1967)  hypothesized  fur-
ther  that  “significant  positive  personality  change  does  not  occur  except  in  a  rela-
tionship” (p. 73). Rogers’s hypothesis was formulated on the basis of many years of 
his professional experience, and it remains basically unchanged to this day.
1.
 Two persons are in psychological contact.
2. The first, whom we shall term the client, is in a state of incongruence, 
being vulnerable or anxious.
3.
 The second person, whom we term the therapist, is congruent (real or 
genuine) in the relationship, and this congruence is perceived by the 
client.
4.
 The therapist experiences unconditional positive regard for the 
client.
5. The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client’s 
internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experi-
ence to the client.
6. The communication to the client of the therapist’s empathic under-
standing and unconditional positive regard is to a minimal degree 
achieved. (as cited in Cain 2002a, p. 20)
Rogers  hypothesized  that  no  other  conditions  were  necessary.  If  the  therapeutic 
core  conditions  exist  over  some  period  of  time,  constructive  personality  change  
will occur. The core conditions do not vary according to client type. Further, they 
are both necessary and sufficient for therapeutic change to occur.
From Rogers’s perspective, the client–therapist relationship is characterized by 
equality. Therapists do not keep their knowledge a secret or attempt to mystify the 
therapeutic  process.  The  process  of  change  in  the  client  depends  to  a  large  degree

on the quality of this equal relationship. As clients experience the therapist listen-
ing  in  an  accepting  way  to  them,  they  gradually  learn  how  to  listen  acceptingly  to  
themselves. As they find the therapist caring for and valuing them (even the aspects 
that have been hidden and regarded as negative), clients begin to develop worth and 
value  in  themselves.  As  they  experience  the  realness  of  the  therapist,  clients  drop  
many of their pretenses and become real with both themselves and the therapist.
This humanistic approach is perhaps best characterized as a way of being and as a 
shared journey in which therapist and client reveal their humanness and participate in 
a growth experience. The therapist can be a relational guide on this journey because 
he  or  she  is  usually  more  psychologically  experienced  in  this  role  than  the  client.  
Therapists are invested in broadening their own life experiences and are willing to 
do what it takes to deepen their self-knowledge.
Rogers admitted that his theory was strikingly provocative and radical. His for-
mulation has generated considerable controversy, for he maintained that many con-
ditions other therapists commonly regard as necessary for effective psychotherapy 
were nonessential. The core therapist conditions of congruence, unconditional posi-
tive regard, and accurate empathic understanding subsequently have been embraced 
by  many  therapeutic  schools  as  essential  in  facilitating  therapeutic  change.  These  
core qualities of therapists, along with the therapist’s presence, work holistically to 
create a safe environment for learning (Cain, 2010). Regardless of theoretical orien-
tation,  most  therapists  strive  to  listen  fully  and  empathically  to  clients,  especially  
during  the  initial  stages  of  therapy.  We  now  turn  to  a  detailed  discussion  of  how  
these core conditions are an integral part of the therapeutic relationship.
Congruence, or Genuineness congruence implies that therapists are real; that 
is,  they  are  genuine,  integrated,  and  authentic  during  the  therapy  hour.  They  are  
without a false front, their inner experience and outer expression of that experience 
match, and they can openly express feelings, thoughts, reactions, and attitudes that 
are  present  in  the  relationship  with  the  client.  This  communication  is  done  with  
careful reflection and considered judgment on the therapist’s part (Kolden, Klein, 
Wang, & Austin, 2011).
Through authenticity the therapist serves as a model of a human being strug-
gling  toward  greater  realness.  Being  congruent  might  necessitate  expressing  a  
range of feelings including anger, frustration, liking, concern, and annoyance. This 
does not mean that therapists should impulsively share all their reactions, for self-
disclosure  must  be  appropriate,  well  timed,  and  have  a  constructive  therapeutic  
intent.  Counselors  can  try  too  hard  to  be  genuine;  sharing  because  they  think  it  
will  be  good  for  the  client,  without  being  genuinely  moved  to  express  something  
regarded  as  personal,  can  be  incongruent.  Person-centered  therapy  stresses  that  
counseling will be inhibited if the counselor feels one way about the client but acts 
in a different way. For example, if the practitioner dislikes or disapproves of the cli-
ent but feigns acceptance, therapy will be impaired. Cain (2010) stresses that thera-
pists need to be attuned to the emerging needs of the client and to respond in ways 
that are in the best interests of the individual. If therapists keep this in mind, they 
are likely to make sound therapeutic decisions most of the time.
Rogers’s concept of congruence does not imply that only a fully self-actualized 
therapist can be effective in counseling. Because therapists are human, they cannot

be  expected  to  be  fully  authentic.  Congruence  exists  on  a  continuum  from  highly  
congruent to very incongruent. This is true of all three characteristics.
Unconditional Positive Regard and Acceptance The second attitude therapists 
need  to  communicate  is  deep  and  genuine  caring  for  the  client  as  a  person.   
Unconditional positive regard can best be achieved through empathic identifica-
tion  with  the  client  (Farber  &  Doolin,  2011).  The  caring  is  nonpossessive  and  is  
not  contaminated  by  evaluation  or  judgment  of  the  client’s  feelings,  thoughts,  
and behavior as good or bad. Therapists value and warmly accept clients without 
placing  stipulations  on  their  acceptance.  It  is  not  an  attitude  of  “I’ll  accept  you  
when
 . . . ”; rather, it is one of “I’ll accept you as you are.” Therapists communicate 
through their behavior that they value their clients as they are and that clients are 
free to have feelings and experiences.
According to Rogers’s (1977) research, the greater the degree of caring, prizing, 
accepting, and valuing of the client in a nonpossessive way, the greater the chance 
that therapy will be successful. He also makes it clear that it is not possible for thera-
pists to genuinely feel acceptance and unconditional caring at all times. However, if 
therapists have little respect for their clients, or an active dislike or disgust, it is not 
likely that the therapeutic work will be fruitful. If therapists’ caring stems from their 
own need to be liked and appreciated, constructive change in the client is inhibited. 
This notion of positive regard has implications for all therapists, regardless of their 
theoretical orientation (Farber & Doolin, 2011).
Accurate Empathic Understanding One of the main tasks of the therapist is 
to  understand  clients’  experience  and  feelings  sensitively  and  accurately  as  they  
are  revealed  in  the  moment-to-moment  interaction  during  the  therapy  session.  
The therapist strives to sense clients’ subjective experience, particularly in the here 
and now. The aim is to encourage clients to get closer to themselves, to feel more 
deeply  and  intensely,  and  to  recognize  and  resolve  the  incongruity  that  exists  
within them.
empathy  is  a  deep  and  subjective  understanding  of  the  client  with  the  client.  
Empathy is not sympathy, or feeling sorry for a client. Therapists are able to share 
the  client’s  subjective  world  by  drawing  from  their  own  experiences  that  may  be  
similar to the client’s feelings. Yet therapists must not lose their own separateness. 
Rogers asserts that when therapists can grasp the client’s private world as the client 
sees and feels it—without losing the separateness of their own identity—constructive 
change is likely to occur. Empathy, particularly emotionally focused empathy, helps 
clients (1) pay attention to and value their experiencing, (2) process their experience 
both cognitively and bodily, (3) view prior experiences in new ways, and (4) increase 
their confidence in making choices and in pursuing a course of action (Cain, 2010).
Clark (2010) describes an integral model of empathy in the counseling process 
that is based on three ways of knowing: (1) subjective empathy enables practitioners to 
experience what it is like to be the client; (2) interpersonal empathy pertains to under-
standing a client’s internal frame of reference and conveying a sense of the private 
meanings to the person; and (3) objective empathy relies on knowledge sources outside 
of a client’s frame of reference. By using a multiple-perspective model of empathy, 
counselors have a broader way to understand clients.

Accurate  empathy  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  person-centered  approach,  and  it  
is a necessary ingredient of any effective therapy (Cain, 2010). accurate empathic 
understanding implies that the therapist will sense clients’ feelings as if they were 
his or her own without becoming lost in those feelings. It is a way for therapists to 
hear the meanings expressed by their clients that often lie at the edge of their aware-
ness.  A  primary  means  of  determining  whether  an  individual  experiences  a  thera-
pist’s empathy is to secure feedback from the client (Norcross, 2010).
According to Watson (2002), full empathy entails understanding the meaning 
and  feeling  of  a  client’s  experiencing.  It  is  like  grasping  “what  it  is  like  to  be  you.”  
Empathy is an active ingredient of change that facilitates clients’ cognitive processes 
and emotional self-regulation. Watson’s comprehensive review of the research litera-
ture on therapeutic empathy has consistently demonstrated that therapist empathy 
is  the  most  potent  predictor  of  client  progress  in  therapy.  Empathy  is  an  essential  
component of successful therapy in every therapeutic modality.
Clients’ perceptions of feeling understood by their therapists relate favorably to 
outcome. Empathic therapists strive to discover the meaning of the client’s experi-
ence,  understand  the  overall  goals  of  the  client,  and  tailor  their  responses  to  the  
particular  client.  Effective  empathy  is  grounded  in  authentic  caring  for  the  client  
(Elliott, Bohart, Watson, & Greenberg, 2011).
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
Early Emphasis on Reflection of Feelings
Rogers’s  original  emphasis  was  on  grasping  the  world  of  the  client  and  reflecting  
this  understanding.  As  his  view  of  psychotherapy  developed,  however,  his  focus  
shifted away from an absolutist, nondirective stance and emphasized the therapist’s 
relationship  with  the  client.  Many  followers  of  Rogers  simply  imitated  his  reflec-
tive style, and client-centered therapy has often been identified primarily with the 
technique  of  reflection  despite  Rogers’s  contention  that  the  therapist’s  relational  
attitudes and fundamental ways of being with the client constitute the heart of the 
change process. Rogers and other contributors to the development of the person-
centered  approach  have  been  critical  of  the  stereotypic  view  that  this  approach  is  
basically a simple restatement of what the client just said.
Evolution of Person-Centered Methods
Contemporary person-centered therapy is the result of an evolutionary pro-
cess of more than 70 years, and it continues to remain open to change and refine-
ment. One of Rogers’s main contributions to the counseling field is the notion that 
the quality of the therapeutic relationship, as opposed to administering techniques, 
is  the  primary  agent  of  growth  in  the  client.  The  therapist’s  ability  to  establish  a  
strong connection with clients is the critical factor determining successful counsel-
ing outcomes.
No techniques are basic to the practice of person-centered therapy; “being with” 
clients  and  entering  imaginatively  into  their  world  of  perceptions  and  feelings  is  
sufficient  for  facilitating  a  process  of  change.  Person-centered  therapists  are  not

prohibited from suggesting techniques, but how these suggestions are presented is 
crucial.  Some  clients  do  better  with  more  direction,  whereas  others  do  better  in  a  
nondirective climate (Cain, 2010). What is essential for clients’ progress is the thera-
pist’s presence—being completely attentive to and immersed in the client as well as 
in the client’s expressed concerns (Cain, 2010). Qualities and skills such as listening, 
accepting,  respecting,  understanding,  and  responding  must  be  honest  expressions  
by the therapist. Techniques may be suggested when doing so fosters the process of 
client and therapist being together in an empathic way. Techniques are not attempts 
at “doing anything” to a client (Bohart & Watson, 2011).
Rogers expected person-centered therapy to continue to evolve and supported 
others  in  breaking  new  ground.  One  of  the  main  ways  in  which  person-centered  
therapy  has  evolved  is  the  diversity,  innovation,  and  individualization  in  practice.  
There is no longer one way of practicing person-centered therapy (Cain, 2010), and 
there has been increased latitude for therapists to share their reactions, to confront 
clients in a caring way, and to participate more actively and fully in the therapeutic 
process (Bozarth et al., 2002). 
immediacy, or addressing what is going on between 
the client and therapist, is highly valued in this approach. This development encour-
ages  the  use  of  a  wider  variety  of  methods  and  allows  for  considerable  diversity  in  
personal  style  among  person-centered  therapists.  The  shift  toward  genuineness  
enables person-centered therapists both to practice in more flexible and integrative 
ways that suit their personalities and to have greater flexibility in tailoring the coun-
seling relationship to suit different clients (Bohart & Watson, 2011).
Cain (2010, 2013) believes it is essential for therapists to adapt their therapeutic 
style to accommodate the unique needs of each client. Person-centered therapists 
have the freedom to use a variety of responses and methods to assist their clients; 
a guiding question therapists need to ask is, “Does it fit?” Cain contends that, ide-
ally, therapists will continually monitor whether what they are doing fits, especially 
whether their therapeutic style is compatible with their clients’ way of viewing and 
understanding  their  problems.  For  an  illustration  of  how  Dr.  David  Cain  works  
with the case of Ruth in a person-centered style, see Case Approach to Counseling and 
Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 5).
Today, those who practice a person-centered approach work in diverse ways that 
reflect both advances in theory and practice and a plethora of personal styles. This is 
appropriate and fortunate, for none of us can emulate the style of Carl Rogers and 
still be true to ourselves. If we strive to model our style after Rogers, and if that style 
does not fit for us, we are not being ourselves and we are not being fully congruent.
The Role of Assessment
Assessment  is  frequently  viewed  as  a  prerequisite  to  the  treatment  process.  Many  
mental health agencies use a variety of assessment procedures, including diagnostic 
screening, identification of clients’ strengths and liabilities, and various tests. Person-
centered therapists generally do not find traditional assessment and diagnosis to be 
useful because these procedures encourage an external and expert perspective on the 
client (Bohart & Watson, 2011). What matters is not how the counselor assesses the 
client but the client’s self-assessment. From a person-centered perspective, the best 
source of knowledge about the client is the individual client. Rogers saw therapy as

co-assessment, whereby the therapist and the client engage in a continuous process 
of self-understanding.
Assessment seems to be gaining in importance in short-term treatments in most 
counseling agencies, and it is imperative that clients be involved in a collaborative 
process in making decisions that are central to their therapy. Today it may not be a 
question of whether to incorporate assessment into therapeutic practice but of how 
to involve clients as fully as possible in their assessment and treatment process.
Application of the Philosophy of the Person-Centered Approach
The person-centered approach has been applied to working with individuals, groups, 
and  families.  Bozrath,  Zimring,  and  Tausch  (2002)  cite  studies  done  through  the  
1990s that revealed the effectiveness of person-centered therapy with a wide range 
of  client  problems  including  anxiety  disorders,  alcoholism,  psychosomatic  prob-
lems,  agoraphobia,  interpersonal  difficulties,  depression,  cancer,  and  personality  
disorders. Person-centered therapy has been shown to be as viable as the more goal-
oriented therapies. Furthermore, outcome research conducted in the 1990s revealed 
that effective therapy is based on the client–therapist relationship in combination 
with  the  inner  and  external  resources  of  the  client  (Duncan,  Miller,  Wampold,  &  
Hubble, 2010).
The person-centered approach has been applied extensively in training both pro-
fessionals and paraprofessionals who work with people in a variety of settings. This 
approach emphasizes staying with clients as opposed to getting ahead of them with 
interpretations. People without advanced psychological education are able to ben-
efit by translating the therapeutic conditions of genuineness, empathic understand-
ing,  and  unconditional  positive  regard  into  both  their  personal  and  professional  
lives. Learning to listen to oneself with acceptance is a valuable life skill that enables 
individuals to be their own therapists. The basic concepts are straightforward and 
easy to comprehend, and they encourage locating power in the person rather than 
fostering an authoritarian structure in which control and power are denied to the 
person. These core skills also provide an essential foundation for virtually all of the 
other therapy systems covered in this book. If counselors are lacking in these rela-
tionship and communication skills, they will not be effective in carrying out a treat-
ment program for their clients.
The person-centered approach demands a great deal of the therapist. An effective 
person-centered therapist must be an astute listener who is grounded, centered, gen-
uine, respectful, caring, present, focused, patient, and accepting in a way that involves 
maturity. Without a person-centered way of being, mere application of skills is likely 
to be hollow. Natalie Rogers (2011) points out that the person-centered approach is 
a way of being that is easy to understand intellectually but is very difficult to put into 
practice.  She  continues  to  find  the  core  conditions  of  genuineness,  positive  regard,  
and empathy most important in developing trust, safety, and growth in a group.
Application to Crisis Intervention
The person-centered approach is especially applicable in crisis intervention 
such as an unwanted pregnancy, an illness, a disastrous event, or the loss of a loved 
one. People in the helping professions (nursing, medicine, education, the ministry)

are often first on the scene in a variety of crises, and they can do much if the basic 
attitudes  described  in  this  chapter  are  present.  When  people  are  in  crisis,  one  of  
the first steps is to give them an opportunity to fully express themselves. Sensitive 
listening, hearing, and understanding are essential at this point. Being heard and 
understood helps ground people in crises, helps to calm them in the midst of tur-
moil, and enables them to think more clearly and make better decisions. Although 
a  person’s  crisis  is  not  likely  to  be  resolved  by  one  or  two  contacts  with  a  helper,  
such contacts can pave the way for being open to receiving help later. If the person 
in crisis does not feel understood and accepted, he or she may lose hope of “return-
ing to normal” and may not seek help in the future. Genuine support, caring, and 
nonpossessive  warmth  can  go  a  long  way  in  building  bridges  that  can  motivate  
people  to  do  something  to  work  through  and  resolve  a  crisis.  Communicating  a  
deep  sense  of  understanding  should  always  precede  other  more  problem-solving  
interventions.
In crisis situations person-centered therapists may need to provide more struc-
ture and direction than would be the case for clients who are not experiencing a cri-
sis. Suggestions, guidance, and even direction may be called for if clients are not able 
to function effectively. For example, it may be necessary to take action to hospitalize 
a suicidal client to protect this person from self-harm.
Application to Group Counseling
The person-centered approach emphasizes the unique role of the group counselor 
as  a  facilitator  rather  than  a  leader.  The  primary  function  of  the  facilitator  is  to  
create a safe and healing climate—a place where the group members can interact in 
honest  and  meaningful  ways.  In  this  climate  members  become  more  appreciative  
and  trusting  of  themselves  as  they  are  and  are  able  to  move  toward  self-direction  
and  empowerment.  The  facilitator’s  way  of  being  can  create  a  productive  climate  
within a group:
Facilitators  cannot  make  participants  trust  the  group  process.  Facilitators  earn  
trust by being respectful, caring, and even loving. Being an effective group facilita-
tor has much to do with one’s “way of being.” No method or technique can evoke 
trust unless the facilitator herself has a capacity to be fully present, considerate, 
caring,  authentic,  and  responsive.  This  includes  the  ability  to  challenge  people  
constructively. (N. Rogers, 2011, p. 57)
With the presence of the facilitator and the support of other members, participants 
realize that they do not have to experience the struggles of change alone and that 
groups as collective entities have their own source of transformation.
Carl  Rogers  (1970)  clearly  believed  that  groups  tend  to  move  forward  if  the  
facilitator  exhibits  a  deep  sense  of  trust  in  the  members  and  refrains  from  using  
techniques  or  exercises  to  get  a  group  moving.  Facilitators  should  avoid  making  
interpretive  comments  or  group  process  observations  because  such  comments  are  
apt  to  make  the  group  self-conscious  and  slow  the  process  down.  Group  process  
observations  should  come  from  members,  a  view  that  is  consistent  with  Rogers’s  
philosophy of placing the responsibility for the direction of the group on the mem-
bers.  Instead  of  leading  the  members  toward  specific  goals,  the  group  facilitator

assists members in developing attitudes and behaviors of genuineness, acceptance, 
and empathy, which enables the members to interact with each other in therapeutic 
ways to find their own sense of direction as a group.
Regardless of a group leader’s theoretical orientation, the core conditions that 
have been described here are highly applicable to any leader’s style of group facilita-
tion. Only when the leader is able to create a person-centered climate will movement 
take place within a group. All of the theories discussed in this book depend on the 
quality of the therapeutic relationship as a foundation. As you will see, the cognitive 
behavioral  approaches  to  group  work  also  emphasize  creating  a  working  alliance  
and  collaborative  relationships.  Indeed,  most  effective  approaches  to  group  work  
share key elements of a person-centered philosophy. For a more detailed treatment 
of  person-centered  group  counseling,  see  Corey  (2016,  chap.  10).  Also  see  Natalie  
Rogers’s book (2011), The Creative Connection for Groups: Person-Centered Expressive Arts 
for Healing and Social Change.
Person-Centered Expressive Arts Therapy*
Natalie Rogers (1993, 2011) expanded on her father’s (C. Rogers, 1961) the-
ory of creativity using the expressive arts to enhance personal growth for individuals 
and groups. N. Rogers’s approach, known as expressive arts therapy, extends the 
person-centered  approach  to  spontaneous  creative  expression,  which  symbolizes  
deep and sometimes inaccessible feelings and emotional states. Counselors trained 
in person-centered expressive arts offer their clients the opportunity to create move-
ment, visual art, journal writing, sound, and music to express their feelings and gain 
insight from these activities.
Principles of Expressive Arts Therapy
Expressive  arts  therapy  uses  various  artistic  forms—movement,  drawing,  painting,  
sculpting,  music,  writing,  and  improvisation—toward  the  end  of  growth,  healing,  
and  self-discovery.  This  is  a  multimodal  approach  integrating  mind,  body,  emo-
tions,  and  inner  spiritual  resources.  Methods  of  expressive  arts  therapy  are  based  
on humanistic principles but give fuller form to Carl Rogers’s notions of creativity. 
These principles include the following (N. Rogers, 1993):
All people have an innate ability to be creative.
The creative process is transformative and healing. The healing aspects 
involve activities such as meditation, movement, art, music, and journal 
writing.
Personal growth and higher states of consciousness are achieved 
through self-awareness, self-understanding, and insight.

Self-awareness, understanding, and insight are achieved by delving into 
our feelings of grief, anger, pain, fear, joy, and ecstasy.
Our feelings and emotions are an energy source that can be channeled 
into the expressive arts to be released and transformed.
The expressive arts lead us into the unconscious, thereby enabling us to 
express previously unknown facets of ourselves and bring to light new 
information and awareness.
One art form stimulates and nurtures the other, bringing us to an inner 
core or essence that is our life energy.
A connection exists between our life force—our inner core, or soul—and 
the essence of all beings.
As we journey inward to discover our essence or wholeness, we discover  
our relatedness to the outer world, and the inner and outer become one.
The various art modes interrelate in what Natalie Rogers calls the “creative connec-
tion.”  When  we  move,  it  affects  how  we  write  or  paint.  When  we  write  or  paint,  it  
affects how we feel and think.
Natalie  Rogers’s  approach  is  based  on  a  person-centered  theory  of  individual  
and group process. The same conditions that Carl Rogers and his colleagues found 
basic to fostering a facilitative client–counselor relationship also help support cre-
ativity.  Personal  growth  takes  place  in  a  safe,  supportive  environment  created  by  
counselors or facilitators who are genuine, warm, empathic, open, honest, congru-
ent,  and  caring—qualities  that  are  best  learned  by  first  being  experienced.  Taking  
time to reflect on and evaluate these experiences allows for personal integration at 
many levels—intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual.
Creativity and Offering Stimulating Experiences
According  to  Natalie  Rogers,  this  deep  faith  in  the  individual’s  innate  drive  to  
become  fully  oneself  is  basic  to  the  work  in  person-centered  expressive  arts.  Indi-
viduals have a tremendous capacity for self-healing through creativity if given the 
proper environment. When one feels appreciated, trusted, and given support to use 
individuality to develop a plan, create a project, write a paper, or to be authentic, the 
challenge is exciting, stimulating, and gives a sense of personal expansion. N. Rogers 
believes the tendency to actualize and become one’s full potential, including innate 
creativity, is undervalued, discounted, and frequently squashed in our society. Tra-
ditional educational institutions tend to promote conformity rather than original 
thinking and the creative process.
Person-centered expressive arts therapy utilizes the arts for spontaneous cre-
ative  expression  that  symbolizes  deep  and  sometimes  inaccessible  feelings  and  
emotional  states.  The  conditions  that  foster  creativity  require  acceptance  of  the  
individual, a nonjudgmental setting, empathy, psychological freedom, and avail-
ability of stimulating and challenging experiences. With this type of environment 
in  place,  the  facilitative  internal  conditions  of  the  client  are  encouraged  and  
inspired.  The  client  experiences  a  nondefensive  openness  and  an  internal  locus  of  
evaluation  that  receives  but  is  not  overly  concerned  with  the  reactions  of  others.  
N. Rogers (1993) believes that we cheat ourselves out of a fulfilling and joyous source

realm  of  creativity.  Art  is  not  only  for  the  few  who  develop  a  talent  or  master  a

growth.
Motivational Interviewing
Motivational  interviewing  (Mi)  is  a  humanistic,  client-centered,  psycho-
social, and modestly directive counseling approach developed by William R. Miller 
and Stephen Rollnick in the early 1980s. The clinical and research applications of 
this evidenced-based practice have received increased attention in recent years, and 
MI has been shown to be effective as a relatively brief intervention (Corbett, 2016; 
Dean, 2015). Motivational interviewing is based on humanistic principles, has many 
basic similarities with person-centered therapy, and expands the traditional person-
centered approach.
Motivational interviewing was initially designed as a brief intervention for prob-
lem drinking, but more recently this approach has been applied to a wide range of 
clinical problems including substance abuse, compulsive gambling, eating disorders, 
anxiety disorders, depression, suicidality, chronic disease management, and health 
behavior change practices (Arkowitz & Miller, 2008; Arkowitz & Westra, 2009). MI 
stresses  client  self-responsibility  and  promotes  an  invitational  style  for  working  
cooperatively with clients to generate alternative solutions to behavioral problems. 
MI provides multiple ways to address the impasses clients often experience during 
the change process. Both MI and person-centered practitioners believe in the client’s 
abilities, strengths, resources, and competencies. The underlying assumption is that 
clients want to be healthy and desire positive change.
The MI Spirit
MI is rooted in the philosophy of person-centered therapy, but with a “twist.” Unlike 
the  nondirective  and  unstructured  person-centered  approach,  MI  is  deliberately  
directive while staying within the client’s frame of reference. The primary goal is to 
reduce  client  ambivalence  about  change  and  increase  the  client’s  own  motivation  
for change. Miller and Rollnick (2013) believe that “MI is about arranging conver-
sations so that people talk themselves into change, based on their own values and 
interests” (p. 4). It is essential that therapists function within the spirit of MI—that 
is, within the relational context of therapy—rather than simply applying the strate-
gies of the approach. The attitudes and skills in MI are based on a person-centered 
philosophy and include using open-ended questions, employing reflective listening, 
creating  a  safe  climate,  affirming  and  supporting  the  client,  expressing  empathy,  
responding to resistance in a nonconfrontational manner, guiding a discussion of 
ambivalence, summarizing and linking at the end of sessions, and eliciting and rein-
forcing  “change  talk”  (Dean,  2015).  MI  therapists  avoid  arguing  with  clients  and  
reframe resistance as a healthy response. MI therapists do not view clients as oppo-
nents to be defeated but as allies who play a major role in their present and future 
success. Practitioners assist clients in becoming their own advocates for change and 
the primary agents of change in their lives.

PERSoN-CENTEREd THERAPy         183 
In  both  person-centered  therapy  and  MI,  the  counselor  provides  the  condi-
tions for growth and change by communicating attitudes of accurate empathy and 
unconditional  positive  regard.  In  MI,  the  therapeutic  relationship  is  as  important  
in achieving successful outcomes as the specific theoretical model or school of psy-
chotherapy  from  which  the  therapist  operates  (Miller  &  Rollnick,  2013).  Both  MI  
and person-centered therapy are based on the premise that individuals have within 
themselves the capacity to generate an intrinsic motivation to change. Responsibil-
ity  for  change  rests  with  clients,  not  with  the  counselor,  and  therapist  and  client  
share a sense of hope and optimism that change is possible. Once clients believe that 
they have the capacity to change and heal, new possibilities open up for them.
The Basic Principles of Motivational Interviewing
Miller and Rollnick (2013) formulated five basic principles of MI:
1. Therapists strive to experience the world from the client’s perspec-
tive without judgment or criticism. MI emphasizes reflective listening, 
which is a way for practitioners to better understand the subjective 
world of clients. Expressing empathy is foundational in creating a safe 
climate for clients to explore their ambivalence for change. When cli-
ents are slow to change, they likely have compelling reasons to remain 
as they are as well as having reasons to change.
2.
 MI is designed to evoke and explore both discrepancies and ambiva-
lence. Counselors reflect discrepancies between the behaviors and 
values of clients to increase the motivation to change. Counselors pay 
particular attention to clients’ arguments for changing compared 
to their arguments for not changing. Therapists elicit and reinforce 
change talk by employing specific strategies to strengthen discus-
sion about change. Clinicians encourage clients to determine whether 
change will occur, and if so, what kinds of changes will occur and 
when.
3.
 Reluctance to change is viewed as an expected part of the therapeu-
tic process. Although individuals may see advantages to making life 
changes, they also may have many concerns and fears about changing. 
People who seek therapy are often ambivalent about change, and their 
motivation may ebb and flow during the course of therapy. MI thera-
pists assume a respectful view of resistance and work therapeutically 
with any reluctance or caution on the part of clients. MI practitioners 
avoid disagreeing with, arguing with, or persuading clients because this 
only entrenches resistance. Instead, therapists roll with the resistance, 
which tends to reduce clients’ defensiveness (Corbett, 2016).
4. Practitioners support clients’ self-efficacy, mainly by encouraging them 
to use their own resources to take necessary actions that can lead to 
success in changing. MI clinicians strive to enhance client agency about 
change and emphasize the right and inherent ability of clients to for-
mulate their own personal goals and to make their own decisions. MI 
focuses on present and future conditions and empowers clients to find 
ways to achieve their goals.

5. When clients show signs of readiness to change through decreased 
resistance to change and increased talk about change, a critical phase 
of MI begins. In this stage, clients may express a desire and ability 
to change, show an interest in questions about change, experiment 
with making changes between sessions, and envision a future picture 
of how their life will be different once the desired changes have been 
made. At this time therapists shift their focus toward strengthen-
ing clients’ commitments to change and helping them implement a 
change plan.
The Stages of Change
The  stages  of  change  model  assumes  that  people  progress  through  a  series  of  five  
identifiable  stages  in  the  counseling  process.  In  the  precontemplation  stage,  there  is  
no intention of changing a behavior pattern in the near future. In the contemplation 
stage,  people  are  aware  of  a  problem  and  are  considering  overcoming  it,  but  they  
have not yet made a commitment to take action to bring about the change. In the 
preparation  stage,  individuals  intend  to  take  action  immediately  and  report  some  
small behavioral changes. In the action stage, individuals are taking steps to modify 
their behavior to solve their problems. During the maintenance stage, people work to 
consolidate their gains and prevent relapse.
People  do  not  pass  neatly  through  these  five  stages  in  linear  fashion,  and  a  
client’s  readiness  can  fluctuate  throughout  the  change  process.  If  change  is  ini-
tially  unsuccessful,  individuals  may  return  to  an  earlier  stage  (Prochaska  &  
Norcross, 2014). MI therapists strive to match specific interventions with whatever 
stage  of  change  clients  are  experiencing.  If  there  is  a  mismatch  between  process  
and stage, movement through the stage will be impeded and is likely to be mani-
fested in reluctant behavior. When clients demonstrate any form of reluctance or 
resistance,  this  could  be  due  to  a  therapist’s  misjudgment  of  a  client’s  readiness   
to change.
Motivational  interviewing  is  but  one  example  of  how  therapeutic  strategies  
have  been  developed  based  on  the  foundational  principles  and  philosophy  of  the  
person-centered approach. Indeed, most of the therapeutic models illustrate how 
the  core  therapeutic  conditions  are  necessary  aspects  leading  to  client  change.  
Where many therapeutic approaches, including motivational interviewing, diverge 
from  traditional  person-centered  therapy  is  the  assumption  that  the  therapeutic  
factors are both necessary and sufficient in bringing about change. Many other mod-
els employ specific intervention strategies to address specific concerns clients bring 
to therapy.
Person-Centered Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
One of the strengths of the person-centered approach is its impact on the 
field of human relations with diverse cultural groups. Person-centered philosophy 
and  practice  can  now  be  studied  in  several  European  countries,  South  America,

and Japan. Here are some examples of ways in which this approach has been incor-
porated in various countries and cultures:
In several European countries person-centered concepts have had a sig-
nificant impact on the practice of counseling as well as on education, 
cross-cultural communication, and reduction of racial and political 
tensions. In the 1980s Carl Rogers (1987b) elaborated on a theory of 
reducing tension among antagonistic groups that he began developing 
in 1948.
In the 1970s Rogers and his associates began conducting workshops 
promoting cross-cultural communication. Well into the 1980s he led 
large workshops in many parts of the world. International encounter 
groups have provided participants with multicultural experiences.
Japan, Australia, South America, Mexico, and the United Kingdom have 
all been receptive to person-centered concepts and have adapted these 
practices to fit their cultures.
Shortly before his death, Rogers conducted intensive workshops with 
professionals in the former Soviet Union.
There is no doubt that Carl Rogers has had a global impact. His work has reached 
more than 30 countries, and his writings have been translated into 12 languages. The 
emphasis on core conditions makes the person-centered approach useful in under-
standing diverse worldviews. The underlying philosophy of person-centered therapy 
is grounded on the importance of hearing the deeper messages of a client. Empathy, 
being present, and respecting the values of clients are essential attitudes and skills in 
counseling culturally diverse clients. Although person-centered therapists are aware 
of diversity factors, they do not make initial assumptions about individuals (Cain, 
2010, 2013). Therapists realize that each client’s journey is unique and take steps to 
tailor their methods to fit the individual.
Several writers consider person-centered therapy as being ideally suited to clients 
in a diverse world. Bohart and Watson (2011) claim that the person-centered philos-
ophy is particularly appropriate for working with diverse client populations because 
the  counselor  does  not  assume  the  role  of  expert  who  is  going  to  impose  a  “right  
way of being” on the client. Instead, the therapist is a “fellow explorer” who attempts 
to understand the client’s phenomenological world in an interested, accepting, and 
open way and checks with the client to confirm that the therapist’s perceptions are 
accurate.  Motivational  interviewing,  which  is  based  on  the  philosophy  of  person-
centered therapy, is a culturally sensitive approach that can be effective across popu-
lation domains, including gender, age, ethnicity, and sexual orientation (Levensky, 
Kersh, Cavasos, & Brooks, 2008).
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Although  the  person-centered  approach  has  made  significant  contributions  to  
counseling  people  from  diverse  social,  political,  and  cultural  backgrounds,  there  
are  some  shortcomings  to  practicing  exclusively  within  this  framework.  Many  cli-
ents who come to community mental health clinics or who are involved in outpa-
tient treatment want more structure than this approach provides. Some clients seek

professional help to deal with a crisis, to alleviate emotional problems, or to learn 
coping  skills  in  dealing  with  everyday  problems.  These  clients  often  expect  coun-
selors  to  provide  guidance  or  give  advice  and  can  be  put  off  by  this  unstructured  
approach.
A second shortcoming of the person-centered approach is that it is difficult to 
translate  the  core  therapeutic  conditions  into  actual  practice  in  certain  cultures.  
Communication  of  these  core  conditions  must  be  consistent  with  the  client’s  cul-
tural framework. Consider, for example, the expression of therapist congruence and 
empathy.  Clients  accustomed  to  indirect  communication  may  not  be  comfortable  
with direct expressions of empathy or self-disclosure on the therapist’s part.
A  third  shortcoming  in  applying  the  person-centered  approach  with  clients  
from diverse cultures pertains to the fact that this approach extols the value of an 
internal locus of evaluation. The humanistic foundation of person-centered therapy 
emphasizes dimensions such as self-awareness, freedom, autonomy, self-acceptance, 
inner-directedness,  and  self-actualization.  Cain  (2010)  points  out  that  “persons  
from  collectivistic  cultures  are  oriented  less  toward  self-actualization  and  more  
toward intimacy, connection, and harmony with others and toward what is best for 
the community and the common good” (p. 143). The focus on development of indi-
vidual  autonomy  and  personal  growth  may  be  viewed  as  being  selfish  in  a  culture  
that stresses the common good.
Consider  Lupe,  a  Latina  client  who  values  the  interests  of  her  family  over  her  
self-interests.  From  a  person-centered  perspective  she  could  be  viewed  as  being  in  
danger  of  “losing  her  own  identity”  by  being  primarily  concerned  with  her  role  in  
taking care of others in the family. Rather than pushing her to make her personal 
wants  a  priority,  the  counselor  will  explore  Lupe’s  cultural  values  and  her  level  of  
commitment to these values in working with her. It would be inappropriate for the 
counselor to communicate a vision of the kind of woman she should be. (This topic 
is discussed more extensively in Chapter 12.)
Despite these shortcomings, the person-centered approach offers many oppor-
tunities  for  working  with  clients  from  diverse  cultures.  There  is  great  diversity  
among  any  group  of  people,  and  there  is  room  for  a  variety  of  therapeutic  styles.  
Counseling  a  culturally  different  client  may  require  more  activity  and  structuring  
than is usually the case in a person-centered framework, but the potential positive 
impact of a counselor who responds empathically to a culturally different client can-
not be overestimated.
S
tan’s autobiography indicates that he has a sense 
of what he wants for his life. As a person-centered 
therapist,  I  rely  on  his  self-report  of  the  way  he  views  
himself rather than on a formal assessment and diag-
nosis. My concern is with understanding him from his 
internal frame of reference. Stan has stated goals that 
are  meaningful  for  him.  He  is  motivated  to  change  
and  seems  to  have  sufficient  anxiety  to  work  toward  
these desired changes. I have faith in Stan’s ability to 
find his own way, and I trust that he has the necessary 
resources  for  reaching  his  therapy  goals.  I  encourage  
Stan  to  speak  freely  about  the  discrepancy  between  
the  person  he  sees  himself  as  being  and  the  person  
he  would  like  to  become;  about  his  feelings  of  being

a failure, being inadequate; about his fears and uncer-
tainties; and about his hopelessness at times. I attempt 
to create an atmosphere of freedom and security that 
will encourage Stan to explore the threatening aspects 
of his self-concept.
Stan   has   a   low   evaluation   of   his   self-worth.   
Although  he  finds  it  difficult  to  believe  that  others  
really like him, he wants to feel loved. He says, “I hope 
I  can  learn  to  love  at  least  a  few  people,  most  of  all,  
women.” He wants to feel equal to others and not have 
to apologize for his existence, yet most of the time he 
feels  inferior.  By  creating  a  supportive,  trusting,  and  
encouraging  atmosphere,  I  can  help  Stan  learn  to  be  
more  accepting  of  himself,  with  both  his  strengths  
and  limitations.  He  has  the  opportunity  to  openly  
express his fears of women, of not being able to work 
with people, and of feeling inadequate and stupid. He 
can  explore  how  he  feels  judged  by  his  parents  and  
by  authorities.  He  has  an  opportunity  to  express  his  
guilt—that  is,  his  feelings  that  he  has  not  lived  up  to  
his parents’ expectations and that he has let them and 
himself  down.  He  can  also  relate  his  feelings  of  hurt  
over  not  having  ever  felt  loved  and  wanted.  He  can  
express  the  loneliness  and  isolation  that  he  so  often  
feels,  as  well  as  the  need  to  numb  these  feelings  with  
alcohol or drugs.
Stan  is  no  longer  totally  alone,  for  he  is  taking  
the  risk  of  letting  me  into  his  private  world  of  feel-
ings.   Stan   gradually   gets   a   sharper   focus   on   his   
experiencing and is able to clarify his own feelings and 
attitudes. He sees that he has the capacity to make his 
own decisions. In short, our therapeutic relationship 
frees him from his self-defeating ways. Because of the 
caring  and  faith  he  experiences  from  me  in  our  rela-
tionship,  Stan  is  able  to  increase  his  own  faith  and  
confidence in himself.
My  empathy  assists  Stan  in  hearing  himself  and  
accessing  himself  at  a  deeper  level.  Stan  gradually  
becomes  more  sensitive  to  his  own  internal  messages  
and   less   dependent   on   confirmation   from   others   
around  him.  As  a  result  of  the  therapeutic  venture,  
Stan discovers that there is someone in his life whom 
he can depend on—himself.
Questions for Reflection
How would you respond to Stan’s deep feelings 
of self-doubt? Could you enter his frame of refer-
ence and respond in an empathic manner that lets 
Stan know you hear his pain and struggle without 
needing to give advice or suggestions?
How would you describe Stan’s deeper struggles? 
What sense do you have of his world?
To what extent do you think that the relation-
ship you would develop with Stan would help 
him move forward in a positive direction? What, 
if anything, might get in your way—either with 
him or in yourself—in establishing a therapeutic 
relationship?

scale  at  the  beginning  of  this  session.  The  Outcome  
Rating Scale (ORS) is a short questionnaire developed 
by Scott D. Miller that assesses how well a person has 
been doing (individually, interpersonally, socially, and 
overall well-being) during the last week. I explain that 
the  ORS  will  give  us  a  quick  look  at  her  current  level  
of  functioning  and  feeling.  The  ORS  can  also  help  
Gwen  see  which  particular  areas  of  her  life  hold  the  
most  stress  for  her.  Gwen  marks  the  form  quickly,  
and  the  results  indicate  that  personal  well-being  and  
interpersonal  relationships  are  her  most  significant  
areas of challenge. This assessment provides a starting 
point for discussing how our therapeutic relationship 
is contributing to her overall well-being.
Therapist:
 Gwen, I hope that information is helpful 
for you. Where would you like to start today?
Gwen: I need to work on the personal well-being 
issues. I just want to unwind and relax a little 
before I go back into my busy day. I get so tired 
of running around so much. I seem to live in 
an “overwhelm” mode. I am ready to retire that 
way of living. I could use some balance in my life. 
I know that’s why I have been feeling so achy. 
It’s the stress I have been carrying. I can feel the 
tension.
Therapist:
 Would you like to say more about the 
sense of “overwhelm” you mentioned?
Gwen:
 I am always juggling between getting my 
own house in order and putting out fires with 
my mom’s health team or insurance. I work 
hard at my job, and then I come home and need 
to get my own house in order. I am stretched 
in too many directions, and at the end of the 
day I still feel like I am on call and can’t turn 
my mind off. I lay down at night and feel all my 
responsibilities whirling around in my mind. 
Sometimes I just cover my head and hope 
that everything will go away and I can at least 
have some peace at night. I know nothing will 
disappear from my list until I take it off and 
that I have to make an effort to find space for 
relaxation in my life.
Therapist:
 Hearing you explain what “overwhelm 
mode” looks like for you gets my heart rate up 
[immediacy]. Although you know that many 
of your responsibilities will not diminish, you 
would like to find some way of dealing with 
them and find more peace in your life.
Gwen: Yes, but I don’t know where to begin. I can’t 
seem to find time for relaxation.
Therapist: It sounds like you feel unsure about 
where to start and whether you’ll find time for 
yourself at all. I am wondering when you feel 
somewhat relaxed.
Gwen:
 I feel best when I’m caught up with all my 
projects at work and have some time for myself. 
I like it when I have crossed some things off my 
list of things to do. I used to reward myself with 
a spa day when I finished a big project. I haven’t 
done that in ages.
Therapist:
 As you talk about this time, I can see 
how excited you are about crossing things off 
your list and having time for yourself. That’s 
when you really feel good about yourself—when 
you’re accomplishing things yet you realize you 
need to take care of yourself too.
Gwen:
 Before I became the caregiver for my mom, I 
used to get to the gym about three days a week. 
I loved doing dancing and yoga! It really made 
a difference in my stress level. Working out just 
fell by the wayside as my life got busier.
Therapist:
 That must be exhausting; you take care 
of your mom, husband, grown kids, colleagues, 
and everyone else. Yet I hear that you are not 
taking care of yourself. How satisfied are you 
about meeting your own needs right now?
Gwen:
 Not at all. I have totally abandoned myself. I 
am feeling worn down.
Therapist:
 Tell me more about being worn down.
Gwen: I guess saying I am worn down is a bit extreme 
[Gwen is smiling]. My body is definitely telling me 
to slow down and focus on me for a change.
Therapist: So one side is telling you that you can’t 
keep up this pace and you need to take care of 
yourself, and the other side is saying, “Gwen, 
you need to handle everything that’s being 
thrown at you.”
Gwen:
 That sounds right. It’s been a while since I 
actually paid attention to myself. I feel sad saying 
that out loud. I know I want to do something 
different. Even if it’s a small something!

Therapist: You are disappointed in yourself for not 
recognizing that you need a break, and yet you 
seem determined to make some small change 
now. Can you identify what you might begin to 
do differently?
Gwen: I want to make myself a priority. I can 
start taking my breaks at work again and use 
that time to take care of me. I used to do some 
stretching at my desk and walk around the 
building. It was actually fun: we would do a 
pedometer challenge at work. It was good. I 
don’t know why I let all of that go. I just started 
putting everyone and everything in front of me. 
We even have a lunch time dance class I could go 
to. I forgot how happy doing those little things 
used to make me feel.
Therapist:
 It sounds like you regret that some of 
those activities aren’t in you life. What would 
it look like to make yourself a priority in some 
small way?
Gwen:
 I guess I could find 15 minutes to do 
something for myself. I could even go get my hair 
done. Maybe a break in my regular routine would 
be helpful. It’s been forever since I treated myself.
Therapist: With you changing your lifestyle, I want 
to make sure you do it safely. I suggest you ask 
your primary care physician about a physical 
examination to determine any possible reasons 
for the pain and physical symptoms you are 
experiencing.
Gwen: That is a good idea, and I will follow up on 
that suggestion.
Therapist:
 Before you leave, I want to give you 
the Session Rating Scale (SRS). All you have to 
do is rate today’s session based on four items: 
our relationship, goals and topics, therapeutic 
approach, and overall view of our time today. 
It’s similar to the form you filled out at the 
beginning of session.
Gwen  takes  a  moment  to  fill  out  the  form  and  
passes it back with marks reflecting that she felt heard 
and that we talked about what she wanted to discuss. 
She  also  marked  that  there  was  something  missing  
from  the  session,  which  gave  us  an  opportunity  to  
identify what might be missing for her. Using the ORS 
and  the  SRS  is  a  good  way  to  get  Gwen’s  feedback  on  
her own progress and her perception of the value of the 
therapy  session.  As  a  therapist,  I  invite  this  feedback  
and see it as a useful way of getting Gwen’s perspective. 
In  collaboration  with  Gwen,  I  strive  to  make  adjust-
ments  in  my  work  with  her  based  on  her  feedback.  
Gwen then says a few words about how she is feeling.
Gwen: I am definitely not as tense as I was when I 
first came in. I needed to get some things off of 
my chest. I would have liked more suggestions 
from you on what I need to do next. I know you 
don’t have the magic answer, but sometimes that’s 
just what I want.
Therapist: Thanks for your honest feedback. The 
goal is for you to be the director of this session 
and of your life. As you lead the way, your own 
answers will surface to assist you in resolving 
some of your challenges. In today’s session you 
clearly identified areas of stress, and then you 
reconnected with activities that brought you 
peace and relaxation in the past. You were able 
to find your answers within yourself.
Person-centered therapy is a collaborative journey 
driven by what the client brings into the session. I fol-
lowed the lead provided by Gwen of what was troubling 
her  and  attempted  to  work  within  the  framework  of  
what she said she wanted. At each step along the way, 
I show empathy and compassion for her challenges as 
she  works  to  rebuild  self-trust  and  reconnect  to  her  
own sense of personal power and value.
Questions for Reflection
What are your thoughts about soliciting client 
feedback using rating scales such as the ORS and 
the SRS?
Gwen wants more suggestions from her therapist. 
If you were her therapist, how would you intervene 
with her when she wants more direction from you?
How does person-centered therapy fit with who 
you are as a person? Would you be comfortable 
in mostly identifying the client’s underlying mes-
sages as the therapist did in this session?
Frequently person-centered therapists identify con-
flicts or the competing sides of an issue. Where did 
the therapist do this in her dialogue with Gwen?

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Person-centered therapy is based on a philosophy of human nature that postulates 
an innate striving for self-actualization. Carl Rogers’s view of human nature is phe-
nomenological; that is, we structure ourselves according to our perceptions of real-
ity. We are motivated to actualize ourselves in the reality that we perceive.
Rogers’s theory rests on the assumption that clients can understand the factors 
in their lives that are causing them to be distressed. They also have the capacity for 
self-direction  and  constructive  personal  change.  Change  will  occur  if  a  congruent  
therapist makes psychological contact with a client in a state of anxiety or incongru-
ence.  It  is  essential  for  the  therapist  to  establish  a  relationship  the  client  perceives  
as genuine, accepting, and understanding. Therapeutic counseling is based on an 
I/Thou, or person-to-person, relationship in the safety and acceptance of which cli-
ents  drop  their  defenses  and  come  to  accept  and  integrate  aspects  that  they  have  
denied  or  distorted.  The  person-centered  approach  emphasizes  this  personal  rela-
tionship between client and therapist; the therapist’s attitudes are more critical than 
are knowledge, theory, or techniques employed. In the context of this relationship, 
clients unleash their growth potential and become more of the person they are capa-
ble  of  becoming.  An  abundance  of  research  supports  the  notion  that  the  human  
elements of psychotherapy (client factors, therapist effects, and the therapeutic alli-
ance) are far more important than models and techniques in the effectiveness and 
outcomes of therapy (Elkins, 2016).
This  approach  places  primary  responsibility  for  the  direction  of  therapy  on  
the  client.  In  the  therapeutic  context,  individuals  have  the  opportunity  to  decide  
for  themselves  and  come  to  terms  with  their  own  personal  power.  The  underlying  
assumption is that no one knows the client better than the client; in short, the cli-
ent is viewed as an expert on his or her own life (Cain, 2010). The general goals of 
therapy are becoming more open to experience, achieving self-trust, developing an 
internal source of evaluation, and being willing to continue growing. Specific goals 
are not suggested for clients; rather, clients choose their own values and goals. Cur-
rent applications of the theory emphasize more active participation by the therapist 
than  was  the  case  earlier.  Counselors  are  now  encouraged  to  be  fully  involved  as  
persons  in  the  therapeutic  relationship.  More  latitude  is  allowed  for  therapists  to  
express their reactions and feelings as they are appropriate to what is occurring in 
therapy. Person-centered practitioners are willing to be transparent about persistent 
feelings  that  exist  in  their  relationships  with  clients  (Watson  et  al.,  2011).  It  is  the  
therapist’s  job  to  adapt  and  accommodate  in  a  manner  that  works  best  for  each  
client, which means being flexible in the application of methods in the counseling 
process (Cain, 2010).
Contributions of the Person-Centered Approach
When  Carl  Rogers  founded  nondirective  counseling  more  than  70  years  
ago, there were very few other therapeutic models. The longevity of this approach is 
certainly a factor to consider in assessing its influence. Rogers had, and his theory 
continues  to  have,  a  major  impact  on  the  field  of  counseling  and  psychotherapy.

When  he  introduced  his  revolutionary  ideas  in  the  1940s,  he  provided  a  powerful  
and radical alternative to psychoanalysis and to the directive approaches then prac-
ticed. Rogers was a pioneer in shifting the therapeutic focus from an emphasis on 
technique and reliance on therapist authority to that of the power of the therapeu-
tic relationship.
Kirschenbaum (2009) contends that the scope and influence of Rogers’s work 
has continued well beyond his death; the person-centered approach is alive, well, and 
expanding. Today there is not one version of person-centered therapy, but a number 
of  continuously  evolving  person-centered  psychotherapies  (Cain,  2010).  Although  
few psychotherapists claim to have an exclusive person-centered theoretical orienta-
tion, the philosophy and principles of this approach permeate the practice of most 
therapists.  Other  schools  of  therapy  are  increasingly  recognizing  the  centrality  of  
the therapeutic relationship as a route to therapeutic change.
Person-centered therapy is strongly represented in Europe, and there is continu-
ing interest in this approach in both South America and the Far East. The person-
centered approach has established a firm foothold in British universities, and some 
of  the  most  in-depth  training  of  person-centered  counselors  is  taking  place  in  the  
United Kingdom today (N. Rogers, 2011).
As  we  have  seen,  Natalie  Rogers  has  made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  
application  of  the  person-centered  approach  by  incorporating  the  expressive  arts  
as  a  medium  to  facilitate  healing  and  social  change,  primarily  in  a  group  setting.  
She has been instrumental in the evolution of the person-centered approach using 
nonverbal methods to enable individuals to heal and to develop. Many individuals 
who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally can find new possibilities for self-
expression through nonverbal channels and through the expressive arts (N. Rogers, 
2011).  Cain  (2010)  believes  “Natalie  Rogers’s  expressive  arts  therapy  represents  a  
major  innovation  in  practice  and  helped  open  the  way  for  other  person-centered  
therapists to expand the variety and range of practice” (p. 60).
Emphasis  on  Research  One  of  Carl  Rogers’s  contributions  to  the  field  of  
psychotherapy  was  his  willingness  to  state  his  concepts  as  testable  hypotheses  and  
to submit them to research. He literally opened the field to research. He was truly a 
pioneer in his insistence on subjecting the transcripts of therapy sessions to critical 
examination   and   applying   research   technology   to   counselor–client   dialogues.   
According to Cain (2010), an enormous body of research, conducted over a period of 
70 years, supports the effectiveness of the person-centered approach. This research 
is  ongoing  in  many  parts  of  the  world  and  continues  to  expand  and  refine  our  
understanding of what constitutes effective psychotherapy. Cain (2010) concludes, 
“person centered therapy is as vital and effective as it has ever been and continues to 
develop in ways that will make it increasingly so in the years to come” (p. 169).
Even his critics give Rogers credit for having conducted and inspired others to 
conduct  extensive  studies  of  counseling  process  and  outcome.  Rogers  presented  a  
challenge to psychology to design new models of scientific investigation capable of 
dealing with the inner, subjective experiences of the person. His theories of therapy 
and personality change have had a tremendous heuristic effect, and though much 
controversy  surrounds  this  approach,  his  work  has  challenged  practitioners  and  
theoreticians to examine their own therapeutic styles and beliefs.

Limitations and Criticisms of the Person-Centered Approach
Although I applaud person-centered therapists for their willingness to subject their 
hypotheses and procedures to empirical scrutiny, some researchers have been criti-
cal of the methodological errors contained in some of these studies. Accusations of 
scientific  shortcomings  involve  using  control  subjects  who  are  not  candidates  for  
therapy,  failing  to  use  an  untreated  control  group,  failing  to  account  for  placebo  
effects, reliance on self-reports as a major way to assess the outcomes of therapy, and 
using inappropriate statistical procedures. In all fairness, these accusations apply to 
the research on many other therapeutic approaches as well.
There is a similar limitation shared by both the person-centered and existential 
(experiential)  approaches.  Neither  of  these  therapeutic  modalities  emphasizes  the  
role of techniques aimed at bringing about change in clients’ behavior. Proponents 
of psychotherapy manuals, or manualized treatment methods for specific disorders, 
find serious limitations in the experiential approaches due to their lack of attention 
to proven techniques and strategies. Those who call for accountability as defined by 
evidence-based  practices  within  the  field  of  mental  health  also  are  quite  critical  of  
the experiential approaches.
I do not believe manualized treatment methods can be considered the gold stan-
dard  in  psychotherapy,  however.  There  is  good  research  demonstrating  that  tech-
niques  account  for  only  15%  of  client  outcome  (see  Duncan  et  al.,  2010),  whereas  
contextual factors have powerful effects on what happens in therapy (Elkins, 2009, 
2012, 2016). Research points to relational and client factors as the main predictors of 
effective therapy. Furthermore, the evaluation of evidence-based practices has been 
broadened to include best available research; the expertise of the clinician; and cli-
ent characteristics, culture, and preferences (see Norcross, Hogan, & Koocher, 2008).
A potential limitation of the person-centered approach is that some students-
in-training  and  practitioners  with  this  orientation  may  have  a  tendency  to  be  very  
supportive of clients without being challenging. Out of their misunderstanding of 
the basic concepts of the approach, some have limited the range of their responses 
and counseling styles mainly to reflections and empathic listening. Although there 
is value in accurately and deeply hearing a client and in reflecting and communicat-
ing understanding, counseling entails more than this. I believe that the therapeutic 
core conditions are necessary for therapy to succeed, yet I do not see them as being 
sufficient conditions for change for all clients at all times. From my perspective, these 
basic attitudes are the foundation on which counselors must then build the skills of 
therapeutic  intervention.  Motivational  interviewing  rests  on  the  therapeutic  core  
conditions, for example, but MI employs a range of strategies that enables clients to 
develop action plans leading to change.
A related challenge for counselors using this approach is to truly support clients in 
finding their own way. Counselors sometimes experience difficulty in allowing clients to 
decide their own specific goals in therapy. It is easy to give lip service to the concept of cli-
ents’ finding their own way, but it takes considerable respect for clients and faith on the 
therapist’s part to encourage clients to listen to themselves and follow their own direc-
tions, particularly when they make choices that are not what the therapist hoped for.
More than any other quality, the therapist’s genuineness determines the power 
of the therapeutic relationship. If therapists submerge their unique identity and style

in a passive and nondirective manner, they are not likely to affect clients in powerful 
ways. Therapist authenticity and congruence are so vital to this approach that those 
who practice within this framework must feel natural in doing so and must find a 
way to express their own reactions to clients. If not, a real possibility is that person-
centered therapy will be reduced to a bland, safe, and ineffectual approach.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. To what degree do you believe clients have the ability to understand 
and resolve their own problems without a great deal of advice or sug-
gestions from a therapist?
2. This therapy approach places considerable importance on congruence 
(realness or genuineness) on the part of the therapist. How confident 
are you that you will be able to be genuine in your interaction with your 
clients?
3.
 The therapeutic relationship is given prominence in this theory. What 
kind of relationship do you hope to create with your clients? Identify 
the characteristics you deem most important.
4.
 Empathy is a core ingredient in person-centered therapy. What do you 
think you can do to increase your ability to develop empathy toward a 
client who you perceive of as being difficult?
5.
 How would it be for you to practice by relying on a minimum of tech-
niques and instead staying tuned into a client’s moment-by-moment 
experience?
Where to Go From Here
In the DVD for Integrative Counseling: The Case of Ruth and Lecturettes, you will see a con-
crete illustration of how I view the therapeutic relationship as the foundation for our 
work together. Refer especially to Session 1 (“Beginning of Counseling”), Session 2 
(“The Therapeutic Relationship”), and Session 3 (“Establishing Therapeutic Goals”) 
for a demonstration of how I apply principles from the person-centered approach to 
my work with Ruth.

On Becoming a Person (C. Rogers, 1961) is one of the 
best primary sources for further reading on person-
centered therapy. This classic book is a collection of 
Rogers’s articles on the process of psychotherapy, its 
outcomes,  the  therapeutic  relationship,  education,  
family  life,  communication,  and  the  nature  of  the  
healthy person.
A Way of Being (C. Rogers, 1980) contains a series of 
writings  on  Rogers’s  personal  experiences  and  per-
spectives, as well as chapters on the foundations and 
applications of the person-centered approach.
The  Creative  Connection:  Expressive  Arts  as  Healing 
(N.  Rogers,  1993)  is  a  practical,  spirited  book  lav-
ishly  illustrated  with  color  and  action  photos  and  
filled  with  fresh  ideas  to  stimulate  creativity,  self-
expression,   healing,   and   transformation.   Natalie   
Rogers combines the philosophy of her father with 
the   expressive   arts   to   enhance   communication   
between client and therapist.
The  Life  and  Work  of  Carl  Rogers  (Kirschenbaum,  
2009)  is  a  definitive  biography  of  Carl  Rogers  that  
follows his life from his early childhood through his 
death. This book illustrates the legacy of Carl Rog-
ers and shows his enormous influence on the field of 
counseling and psychotherapy.

tains  a  clear  discussion  of  person-centered  theory,  
the therapeutic process, evaluation of the approach, 
and future developments.
Humanistic  Psychology:  A  Clinical  Manifesto  (Elkins,  
2009)  offers  an  insightful  critique  of  the  medical  
model of psychotherapy and the myth of empirically 
supported  treatments.  The  author  calls  for  a  rela-
tionship-based approach to psychotherapy that can 
provide both individual and social transformation.

MIRIAM  POLSTER  (1924–2001)  earned  
her  undergraduate  degree  in  music.  She  
was  trained  as  a  classical  vocalist  and  a  
performer of operatic music. Her artistic 
gifts  remained  with  her  throughout  her  
personal and professional life. M. Polster 
led workshops in which music served as a 
framework for assisting clients in explor-
ing personal experiences.
She  was  a  strong  advocate  of  the  
relational  dimension  of  Gestalt  therapy,  
a  counterpoint  to  the  skewed  stereotype  
of  it  as  confrontational  and  technically  
narrow. The freshness of her perspectives, the clarity 
of  her  language,  and  the  excitement  evoked  by  her  
radiance  all  served  to  raise  the  charismatic  poten-
tial  of  the  therapist  who  entered  into  the  realm  of  
simple  fascination  with  the  way  people  
lived their lives. The long arc of her influ-
ence was drawn by a feminine candor and 
conversational  mutuality  that  achieved  
its strength through presence and intelli-
gence more than through forcefulness; of 
relationship more than through manipu-
lation;  of  optimism  more  than  metallic  
rationalism;  and,  at  last,  of  a  wisdom-
based tension that created a natural pro-
gression of experience.
Gestalt  Therapy  Integrated:  Contours  of  
Theory   and   Practice   (1973),   coauthored   
with her husband, Erving Polster, is considered a clas-
sic and a benchmark in the evolution of Gestalt ther-
apy. In Eve’s Daughters: The Forbidden Heroism of Women 
(1992),  M.  Polster  painted  an  eye-opening  picture  of  
Miriam Polster
Miriam Polster
ERVING  POLSTER  (b.  1922)  is  still  pro-
fessionally active and gives presentations, 
therapy demonstrations, and workshops. 
He  is  regularly  featured  at  the  Evolution  
of   Psychotherapy   conference   and   the   
Brief  Therapy  conference.  Erving  Polster  
writes the following about his connection 
with Gestalt Therapy:*
I first became aware of Gestalt Therapy 
in  1953  when  I  attended  a  workshop  
in  Cleveland  with  Frederick  Perls.  He  
was  masterful  in  the  therapy  sessions  
he  conducted  with  those  of  us  who  attended  the  
workshop.  Two  aspects  of  the  experience  stand  
out  for  me.  One  was  the  combination  of  simplic-
ity and power in both his concepts and his thera-
peutic work. The second was the surprising public 
nature of the personal explorations. This openness 
was  revelatory  in  a  process  that  had  been  steeped  
in  privacy.  Yet  this  freedom  seemed  both  natural  
and  daring,  an  enchanting  exemplification  of  the  
drama of living.
These explorations led to the formation of the 
Gestalt  Institute  of  Cleveland,  where  I  was  faculty  
chairman from 1956 to 1973. The courses I created 
there  composed  a  point  of  view  that  became  the  
foundation  of  Gestalt  Therapy  Integrated:  Contours  of  
Theory  and  Practice  (1973),  a  book  coauthored  with  
my wife, Miriam. We moved to San Diego in 
1973 and opened the Gestalt Training Cen-
ter.  People  came  there  for  25  years  from  all  
over  the  world  for  extensive  training  work  
with us. Those were exciting and productive 
days, and Miriam and I had the pleasure of 
our partnership in developing our ideas and 
our training programs.
Some years later, I wrote Every Person’s 
Life  Is  Worth  a  Novel  (1987b)  and  A  Popula-
tion   of   Selves:   A   Therapeutic   Exploration   of   
Personality Diversity (1995) and coauthored 
an anthology of Miriam’s and my writings 
titled From  the  Radical  Center:  The  Heart  of  Gestalt  
Therapy  (1999).  Miriam  died  in  2001,  at  which  
point we had both been retired for two years. After 
she  died,  I  came  out  of  retirement  and  began  to  
explore a new theme, advocating the advancement 
of  psychotherapy  principles  from  a  private  office  
procedure  into  a  communal  application.  I  have  
written  one  book  about  this,  Uncommon  Ground 
(2006),   and   am   currently   completing   another   
book, A  Life  Focus  Revolution:  The  Mind’s  Answer  to  
the Speed of Living.

Introduction
Gestalt  therapy  is  an  existential,  phenomenological,  and  process-based  
approach created on the premise that individuals must be understood in the context 
of their ongoing relationship with the environment. Awareness, choice, and responsi-
bility are cornerstones of practice. The initial goal is for clients to expand their aware-
ness  of  what  they  are  experiencing  in  the  present  moment.  Through  this  awareness,  
change automatically occurs. The approach is phenomenological because it focuses on 
the client’s perceptions of reality and existential because it is grounded in the notion 
that people are always in the process of becoming, remaking, and rediscovering them-
selves. As an existential approach, Gestalt therapy gives special attention to existence 
as individuals experience it and affirms the human capacity for growth and healing 
through interpersonal contact and insight (Yontef, 1995). In a nutshell, this approach 
focuses on the here and now, the what and how of experiencing, the authenticity of the 
therapist, active dialogic inquiry and exploration, and the I/Thou of relating (Brown, 
2007; Resnick, 2015; Wheeler & Axelsson, 2015; Yontef & Jacobs, 2014).
Fritz Perls was the main originator and developer of Gestalt therapy. Although 
Perls was influenced by psychoanalytic concepts, he took issue with Freud’s theory 
on a number of grounds. Whereas Freud’s view of human beings is basically mecha-
nistic, Perls stressed a holistic approach to personality. Freud focused on repressed 
intrapsychic  conflicts  from  early  childhood,  whereas  Perls  valued  examining  the  
present situation. The Gestalt approach focuses much more on process than on con-
tent. This process involves Gestalt therapists putting themselves as fully as possible 
into the experience of the client without judgment, analyzing, or interpreting, while 
concurrently holding a sense of one’s individual, independent presence. Therapists 
devise  experiments  designed  to  increase  clients’  awareness  of  what  they  are  doing  
and how they are doing it moment to moment. Perls asserted that how individuals 
behave  in  the  present  moment  is  far  more  crucial  to  self-understanding  than  why 
they behave as they do. Awareness usually involves insight and sometimes introspec-
tion, but Gestalt therapists consider it to be much more than either. A defining char-
acteristic of awareness is paying attention to the flow of your experience and being in 
contact with what you are doing when you are doing it (Resnick, 2015).
Self-acceptance, knowledge of the environment, responsibility for choices, and 
the ability to make contact with their field (a dynamic system of interrelationships) 
and  the  people  in  it  are  important  awareness  processes  and  goals,  all  of  which  are

the contributions and the character of women in our 
society.  She  spelled  out  the  historical  role  of  women  
and their special heroic contributions to social prog-
ress. However, she went further than their overlooked 
heroism  by  also  postulating  a  picture  of  heroism  
itself.  She  brightened  the  concept  by  reminding  us  
of  the  heroism  that  is  a  part  of  everyday  living.  This  
interweaving  of  women’s  heroism  with  the  heroism  of  
everyday  life  accented  the  value  of  women’s  potential  
for  effecting  new  social  norms.  Women’s  heroism  
had been taken for granted and was relegated to the 
background of social importance. M. Polster tied this 
social  expansion  of  feminine  heroism,  often  part  of  
their ministrations in the world of everyday living, to 
an enlivened understanding of the subtle role of ordi-
nary heroism of people at large.

based on a here-and-now experiencing that is always changing. Clients are expected 
to do their own seeing, feeling, sensing, and interpreting, as opposed to waiting pas-
sively for the therapist to provide them with insights and answers.
contemporary  relational  gestalt  therapy  stresses  dialogue  and  the  I/Thou  
relationship  between  client  and  therapist.  Therapists  emphasize  the  therapeutic  
relationship  and  work  collaboratively  with  clients  in  a  search  for  understanding  
(Wheeler  &  Axelsson,  2015;  Yontef  &  Schulz,  2013).  Following  the  lead  of  Laura  
Perls and the “Cleveland school” when Erving and Miriam Polster and Joseph Zinker 
were on the faculty in the 1960s and 1970s, this model includes more support and 
increased  sensitivity  and  compassion  in  therapy  than  the  confrontational  and  
dramatic  style  of  Fritz  Perls  (Yontef,  1999).  The  majority  of  today’s  Gestalt  ther-
apists  emphasizes  support,  acceptance,  empathy,  respect,  and  dialogue  as  well  as  
confrontation.
Gestalt  therapy  is  lively  and  promotes  direct  experiencing  rather  than  the  
abstractness of talking about situations. Gestalt therapy is an experiential approach 
in that clients come to grips with what and how they are thinking, feeling, and doing 
as  they  interact  with  the  therapist.  Gestalt  practitioners  value  being  fully  present  
during the therapeutic encounter with the belief that growth occurs out of genuine 
contact between client and therapist.

Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the 
brief lecture for each chapter prior to reading the chapter.
Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
The Gestalt view of human nature is rooted in existential philosophy, phe-
nomenology, and field theory. Genuine knowledge is the product of what is imme-
diately  evident  in  the  experience  of  the  perceiver.  Therapy  aims  at  awareness  and  
contact  with  the  environment,  which  consists  of  both  the  external  and  internal  
worlds. The quality of contact with aspects of the external world (for example, other 
people) and the internal world (for example, parts of the self that are disowned) are 
monitored. The process of “reowning” parts of oneself that have been disowned and 
the unification process proceed step by step until clients can carry on with their own 
personal growth. By becoming aware, clients become able to make informed choices 
and thus to live a more meaningful existence.
Due to this view of human nature, Fritz Perls (1969a) practiced Gestalt therapy 
paternalistically.  Clients  have  to  grow  up,  stand  on  their  own  two  feet,  and  “deal  
with their life problems themselves” (p. 225). Perls’s style of doing therapy involved 
two personal agendas: moving the client from environmental support to self-support 
and reintegrating the disowned parts of one’s personality. His conception of human 
nature  and  these  two  agendas  set  the  stage  for  a  variety  of  techniques  and  for  his  
confrontational style of conducting therapy. He was a master at intentionally frus-
trating clients to enhance their awareness.
A  basic  assumption  of  Gestalt  therapy  is  that  individuals  have  the  capacity  
to  self-regulate  when  they  are  aware  of  what  is  happening  in  and  around  them.

Section 214

GEsTAlT THERAPy         201 
Therapy  provides  the  setting  and  opportunity  for  that  awareness  to  be  supported  
and restored. The therapist is attentive to the client’s present experience and trusts 
in  the  process,  thereby  assisting  the  client  in  moving  toward  increased  awareness,  
contact, and integration (Brown, 2007).
The Gestalt theory of change posits that the more we work at becoming who or 
what we are not, the more we remain the same. Fritz’s good friend and psychiatrist 
colleague  Arnie  Beisser  (1970)  suggested  that  authentic  change  occurs  more  from  
being who we are than from trying to be who we are not. Beisser called this simple 
tenet  the  paradoxical  theory  of  change.  We  are  constantly  moving  between  who  
we “should be” and who we “are.” Gestalt therapists ask clients to invest themselves 
fully in their current condition rather than striving to become who they should be. 
Gestalt  therapists  believe  people  change  and  grow  when  they  experience  who  they  
really are in the world (Yontef & Schulz, 2013).
Some Principles of Gestalt Therapy Theory
Several basic principles underlying the theory of Gestalt therapy are briefly 
described  in  this  section:  holism,  field  theory,  the  figure-formation  process,  and  
organismic self-regulation. Other key concepts of Gestalt therapy are developed in 
more detail in the sections that follow.
Holism Gestalt is a German word meaning a whole or completion, or a form that 
cannot be separated into parts without losing its essence. All of nature is seen as a 
unified  and  coherent  whole,  and  the  whole  is  different  from  the  sum  of  its  parts.  
Because Gestalt therapists are interested in the whole person, they place no superior 
value on a particular aspect of the individual. Gestalt practice attends to a client’s 
thoughts, feelings, behaviors, body, memories, and dreams.
Field Theory Gestalt therapy is based on field theory, which, simply put, asserts 
that the organism must be seen in its environment, or in its context, as part of the 
constantly  changing  field.  Gestalt  therapists  pay  attention  to  and  explore  what  is  
occurring at the boundary between the person and the environment. Emphasis may 
be on a figure (those aspects of the individual’s experience that are most salient at 
any moment) or the ground (those aspects of the client’s presentation that are often 
out of his or her awareness). Cues to this background can be found on the surface 
through  physical  gestures,  tone  of  voice,  demeanor,  and  other  nonverbal  content.  
This is often referred to by Gestalt therapists as “attending to the obvious,” while 
paying  attention  to  how  the  parts  fit  together,  how  the  individual  makes  contact  
with the environment, and integration.
The  Figure-Formation  Process  Derived  from  the  study  of  visual  perception  by  a  
group of Gestalt psychologists, the figure-formation process tracks how the individual 
organizes  experience  from  moment  to  moment  as  some  aspect  of  the  environmental  
field  emerges  from  the  background  and  becomes  the  focal  point  of  the  individual’s  
attention and interest. For example, imagine seeing a woman on a hill in the distance. 
You do not see her clearly but receive an overall impression of this figure: a Gestalt. As 
you move closer, you gain more awareness of this figure and she becomes increasingly

clear  and  more  detailed:  you  see  her  face  and  the  way  she  buttons  her  blouse.  In  
the figure-formation process, contemporary Gestalt therapists facilitate the client’s 
movement toward and away from this figure of interest. The dominant needs of the 
individual at a given moment influence this process (Frew, 1997).
Organismic  Self-Regulation  The  figure-formation  process  is  intertwined  with  
the  principle  of  organismic  self-regulation,  a  process  by  which  equilibrium  is  
“disturbed” by the emergence of a need, a sensation, or an interest. Organisms will 
do their best to regulate themselves, given their own capabilities and the resources 
of their environment (Latner, 1986). Individuals can take actions and make contacts 
to  restore  equilibrium  or  to  contribute  to  growth  and  change.  What  emerges  in  
therapeutic  work  is  what  is  of  interest  to  the  client  or  what  the  client  needs  to  
gain  equilibrium  or  to  change.  Gestalt  therapists  direct  the  client’s  awareness  to  
the figures that emerge from the background during a therapy session and use the 
figure-formation process as a guide for the focus of therapeutic work.
Contact and Resistances to Contact
In Gestalt therapy contact is necessary if change and growth are to occur. contact 
is made by seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and moving. Effective contact means 
interacting with nature and with other people without losing one’s sense of individ-
uality. Prerequisites for good contact are clear awareness, full energy, and the ability 
to express oneself. Contact between therapist and client are key to Gestalt therapy 
practice (Yontef & Schulz, 2013; Zinker, 1978). Miriam Polster (1987) claimed that 
contact is the lifeblood of growth. It is the continually renewed creative adjustment 
of  individuals  to  their  environment.  It  entails  zest,  imagination,  and  creativity.  
There are only moments of this type of contact, so it is most accurate to think of 
levels of contact rather than a final state to achieve. After a contact experience, there 
is typically a withdrawal to integrate what has been learned. Gestalt therapists talk 
about  the  two  functions  of  boundaries:  to  connect  and  to  separate.  Both  contact  
and withdrawal are necessary and important to healthy functioning.
Gestalt therapists also focus on interruptions, disturbances, and resistances to 
contact, which were developed as coping processes but often end up preventing us 
from experiencing the present in a full and real way. Resistances are typically adopted 
out  of  our  awareness  and,  when  they  function  in  a  chronic  way,  can  contribute  to  
dysfunctional behavior. Because resistances are developed as a means of coping with 
life situations, they possess positive qualities as well as problematic ones, and many 
contemporary Gestalt therapists refer to them as “contact boundary phenomena.” 
Polster and Polster (1973) describe five different kinds of contact boundary distur-
bances: introjection, projection, retroflection, deflection, and confluence.
introjection is the tendency to uncritically accept others’ beliefs and standards 
without assimilating them to make them congruent with who we are. These introj-
ects remain alien to us because we have not analyzed and restructured them. When 
we  introject,  we  passively  incorporate  what  the  environment  provides  rather  than  
clearly  identifying  what  we  want  or  need.  If  we  remain  in  this  stage,  our  energy  is  
bound up in taking things as we find them and believing that authorities know what 
is best for us rather than working for things ourselves.

Projection is the reverse of introjection. In projection we disown certain aspects 
of ourselves by assigning them to the environment. Those attributes of our person-
ality that are inconsistent with our self-image are disowned and put onto, assigned 
to, and seen in other people; thus, blaming others for lots of our problems. By seeing 
in others the very qualities that we refuse to acknowledge in ourselves, we avoid tak-
ing responsibility for our own feelings and the person who we are, and this keeps us 
powerless to initiate change. People who use projection as a pattern tend to feel that 
they are victims of circumstances, and they believe that people have hidden mean-
ings behind what they say.
retroflection  consists  of  turning  back  onto  ourselves  what  we  would  like  to  
do  to  someone  else  or  doing  to  ourselves  what  we  would  like  someone  else  to  do  
to  or  for  us.  This  process  is  principally  an  interruption  of  the  action  phase  in  the  
cycle of experience and typically involves a fair amount of anxiety. People who rely 
on retroflection tend to inhibit themselves from taking action out of fear of embar-
rassment, guilt, and resentment. People who self-mutilate or who injure themselves, 
for example, are often directing aggression inward out of fear of directing it toward 
others. Depression and psychosomatic complaints are often created by retroflecting. 
Typically, these maladaptive styles of functioning are adopted outside of our aware-
ness;  part  of  the  process  of  Gestalt  therapy  is  to  help  us  discover  a  self-regulatory  
system so that we can deal realistically with the world.
Deflection  is  the  process  of  distraction  or  veering  off,  so  that  it  is  difficult  
to  maintain  a  sustained  sense  of  contact.  We  attempt  to  diffuse  or  defuse  con-
tact through the overuse of humor, abstract generalizations, and questions rather 
than  statements  (Frew,  1986).  When  we  deflect,  we  speak  through  and  for  oth-
ers, beating around the bush rather than being direct and engaging the environ-
ment  in  an  inconsistent  and  inconsequential  basis,  which  results  in  emotional  
depletion.
confluence involves blurring the differentiation between the self and the envi-
ronment.  As  we  strive  to  blend  in  and  get  along  with  everyone,  there  is  no  clear  
demarcation between internal experience and outer reality. Confluence in relation-
ships involves the absence of conflicts, slowness to anger, and a belief that all parties 
experience the same feelings and thoughts we do. This style of contact is character-
istic of clients who have a high need to be accepted and liked, thus finding enmesh-
ment  comfortable.  This  condition  makes  genuine  contact  extremely  difficult.  A  
therapist might assist clients who use this channel of resistance by asking questions 
such as: “What are you doing now?” “What are you experiencing at this moment?” 
“What do you want right now?”
Terms such as interruptions in contact or boundary disturbance refer to the charac-
teristic styles people employ in their attempts to control their environment through 
one of these channels of resistance. The premise in Gestalt therapy is that contact is 
both normal and healthy, and clients are encouraged to become increasingly aware 
of  their  dominant  style  of  blocking  contact  and  their  use  of  resistance.  Today’s  
Gestalt therapists readily attend to how clients interrupt contact, approaching the 
interruptive styles with respect and taking each style seriously, knowing that it has 
served an important function in the past. It is important to explore what the resis-
tance  does  for  clients:  what  it  protects  them  from,  and  what  it  keeps  them  from  
experiencing.

The Now
One  of  the  main  contributions  of  the  Gestalt  approach  is  its  emphasis  on  learn-
ing  to  appreciate  and  fully  experience  the  present  moment.  Focusing  on  the  past  
and the future can be a way to avoid coming to terms with the present. Polster and 
Polster (1973) developed the thesis that “power is in the present.” It is a common 
tendency for clients to invest their energies in bemoaning their past mistakes and 
ruminating  about  how  life  could  and  should  have  been  different  or  engaging  in  
endless  resolutions  and  plans  for  the  future.  As  clients  direct  their  energy  toward  
what was or what might have been or live in fantasy about the future, the power of 
the present diminishes.
Phenomenological  inquiry  involves  paying  attention  to  what  is  occurring  
now. Most people can stay in the present for only a short time and are inclined to 
find ways of interrupting the flow of the present. Instead of experiencing their feel-
ings  in  the  here  and  now,  clients  often  talk  about  their  feelings,  almost  as  if  their  
feelings were detached from their present experiencing. One of the aims of Gestalt 
therapy is to help clients to become increasingly aware of their present experience.
To  help  the  client  make  contact  with  the  present  moment,  Gestalt  therapists  
ask “what” and “how” questions, but rarely ask “why” questions. To promote “now” 
awareness, the therapist encourages a dialogue in the present tense by asking ques-
tions like these: “What is happening now?” “What is going on now?” “What are you 
experiencing as you sit there and attempt to talk?” “What is your awareness at this 
moment?” “How are you experiencing your fear?” “How are you attempting to with-
draw at this moment?” “How is it for you to be with me in this room now?” Phenom-
enological inquiry also involves suspending any preconceived ideas, assumptions, or 
interpretations concerning the meaning of a client’s experience.
For example, if Josephine begins to talk about sadness, pain, or confusion, the 
Gestalt  therapist  invites  her  to  experience  her  sadness,  pain,  or  confusion  now.  As  
she  attends  to  the  present  experience,  the  therapist  gauges  how  much  anxiety  or  
discomfort is present and chooses further interventions accordingly. The therapist 
might choose not to comment as Josephine moves away from the present moment, 
only to extend another invitation several minutes later. If a feeling emerges, the ther-
apist might suggest an experiment that would help Josephine to increase her aware-
ness of the feeling, such as exploring where and how she experiences it. Likewise, if 
a  thought  or  idea  emerges,  introducing  an  experiment  can  help  her  delve  into  the  
thought, explore it more fully, and consider its effects and possible ramifications.
Gestalt therapists recognize that the past will make regular appearances in the 
present moment, usually because of some lack of completion of that past experi-
ence. When the past seems to have a significant bearing on clients’ present attitudes 
or  behavior,  it  is  dealt  with  by  bringing  it  into  the  present  as  much  as  possible.  
When  clients  speak  about  their  past,  the  therapist  may  ask  them  to  reenact  it  as  
though they were living it now. The therapist directs clients to “bring the fantasy 
here”  or  “tell  me  the  dream  as  though  you  were  having  it  now,”  striving  to  help  
them relive what they experienced earlier. For example, rather than talking about 
a past childhood trauma with her father, a client becomes the hurt child and talks 
directly to her father in fantasy, or by imagining him being present in the room in 
an empty chair.

Unfinished Business
When figures emerge from the background but are not completed and resolved, indi-
viduals are left with unfinished business, which can be manifested in unexpressed 
feelings  such  as  resentment,  rage,  hatred,  pain,  anxiety,  grief,  guilt,  and  abandon-
ment.  Unacknowledged  feelings  create  unnecessary  emotional  debris  that  clutters  
present-centered awareness. Because the feelings are not fully experienced in aware-
ness,  they  linger  in  the  background  and  are  carried  into  present  life  in  ways  that  
interfere  with  effective  contact  with  oneself  and  others:  “These  incomplete  direc-
tions do seek completion and when they get powerful enough, the individual is beset 
with preoccupation, compulsive behavior, wariness, oppressive energy and much self-
defeating behavior” (Polster & Polster, 1973, p. 36). Unfinished business persists until 
the individual faces and deals with the unexpressed feelings. The effects of unfinished 
business often show up in some blockage within the body, and the therapist’s task is 
to  assist  clients  in  exploring  these  bodily  expressions.  Gestalt  therapists  emphasize  
paying attention to the bodily experience on the assumption that if feelings are unex-
pressed they tend to result in some physical sensations or problems.
The impasse, or stuck point, occurs when external support is not available or 
the  customary  way  of  being  does  not  work.  The  therapist’s  task  is  to  accompany  
clients in experiencing the impasse without rescuing or frustrating them. The coun-
selor assists clients by providing situations that encourage them to fully experience 
their  condition  of  being  stuck.  By  completely  experiencing  the  impasse,  they  are  
able  to  get  into  contact  with  their  frustrations  and  accept  whatever  is  rather  than  
wishing they were different. Gestalt therapy is based on the notion that individuals 
have a striving toward actualization and growth and that if they accept all aspects 
of themselves without judging these dimensions they can begin to think, feel, and 
act differently.
Energy and Blocks to Energy
When  energy  is  blocked,  in  may  result  in  unfinished  business  (Conyne,  2015).  In  
Gestalt therapy special attention is given to where energy is located, how it is used, 
and how it can be blocked. Blocked energy is another form of defensive behavior. It 
can be manifested by tension in some part of the body, by posture, by keeping one’s 
body tight and closed, by not breathing deeply, by looking away from people when 
speaking to avoid contact, by choking off sensations, by numbing feelings, and by 
speaking with a restricted voice, to mention only a few.
Clients  may  not  be  aware  of  their  energy  or  where  it  is  located,  and  they  may  
experience  it  in  a  negative  way.  One  of  the  tasks  of  the  therapist  is  to  help  clients  
find  the  focus  of  interrupted  energy,  identify  the  ways  in  which  they  are  blocking  
energy, and transform this blocked energy into more adaptive behaviors. Clients can 
be  encouraged  to  recognize  how  their  resistance  is  being  expressed  in  their  body.  
Rather  than  trying  to  rid  themselves  of  certain  bodily  symptoms,  clients  can  be  
encouraged  to  delve  fully  into  tension  states  and  bodily  symptoms.  For  example,  
by allowing themselves to exaggerate their tight mouth and shaking legs, they can 
discover for themselves how they are diverting energy and keeping themselves from 
a full expression of aliveness.

The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
Gestalt therapy does not ascribe to a “goal-oriented” methodology per se, but ther-
apists  clearly  attend  to  a  basic  goal—namely,  assisting  the  client  to  attain  greater  
awareness,  and  with  it,  greater  choice.  Awareness  includes  knowing  the  environ-
ment, knowing oneself, accepting oneself, and being able to make contact. Increased 
and enriched awareness, by itself, is seen as curative. Without awareness clients do 
not possess the tools for personality change. With awareness they have the capacity 
to  face,  accept,  and  integrate  denied  parts  as  well  as  to  fully  experience  their  sub-
jectivity. Through becoming aware of these denied parts and working toward own-
ing their experience, clients can become integrated, or whole. When clients stay with 
their  awareness,  important  unfinished  business  will  emerge  and  can  be  dealt  with  
in therapy. The Gestalt approach helps clients note their own awareness process so 
that they can be responsible and can selectively and discriminatingly make choices. 
Awareness emerges within the context of a genuine meeting (contact) between cli-
ent and therapist.
The existential view (see Chapter 6) is that we are continually engaged in a pro-
cess  of  remaking  and  discovering  ourselves.  We  do  not  have  a  static  identity,  but  
discover new facets of our being as we face new challenges. Gestalt therapy is basi-
cally an existential encounter out of which clients tend to move in certain directions. 
Through a creative involvement in Gestalt process, Zinker (1978) expects clients will 
do the following:
Move toward increased awareness of themselves
Gradually assume ownership of their experience (as opposed to making 
others responsible for what they are thinking, feeling, and doing)
Develop skills and acquire values that will allow them to satisfy their 
needs without violating the rights of others
Become more aware of all of their senses
Learn to accept responsibility for what they do, including accepting the 
consequences of their actions
Be able to ask for and get help from others and be able to give to others
Therapist’s Function and Role
The therapist’s job is to invite clients into an active partnership where they can learn 
about  themselves  by  adopting  an  experimental  attitude  toward  life  in  which  they  
try  out  new  behaviors  and  notice  what  happens  (Perls,  Hefferline,  &  Goodman,  
1951). Gestalt therapists use active methods and personal engagement with clients 
to increase their awareness, freedom, and self-direction rather than directing them 
toward preset goals (Yontef & Jacobs, 2014).
Contemporary  Gestalt  practitioners  view  clients  as  the  experts  on  their  own  
experience and encourage them to attend to their sensory awareness in the present 
moment. Gestalt therapists value self-discovery and assume that clients can discover 
for themselves the ways in which they block or interrupt their awareness and experi-
ence (Watson, Goldman, & Greenberg, 2011). Yontef (1993) stresses that although

the therapist functions as a guide and a catalyst, presents experiments, and shares 
observations,  the  basic  work  of  therapy  is  done  by  the  client.  Yontef  maintains  
that  the  therapist’s  task  is  to  create  a  climate  in  which  clients  are  likely  to  try  out  
new ways of being and behaving. Gestalt therapists do not force change on clients 
through confrontation. Instead, they work within a context of I/Thou dialogue in a 
here-and-now framework.
An important function of Gestalt therapists is paying attention to clients’ body 
language.  These  nonverbal  cues  provide  rich  information  as  they  often  represent  
feelings  of  which  the  client  is  unaware.  The  therapist  needs  to  be  alert  for  gaps  in  
attention and awareness and for incongruities between verbalizations and what cli-
ents  are  doing  with  their  bodies.  Therapists  might  direct  clients  to  speak  for  and  
become  their  gestures  or  body  parts  by  asking,  “What  do  your  eyes  say?”  “If  your  
hands could speak at this moment, what would they say?” “Can you carry on a con-
versation between your right and left hands?” Clients may verbally express anger and 
at the same time smile. Or they may say they are in pain and at the same time laugh. 
Therapists  can  ask  clients  to  become  aware  of  what  their  laughter  might  mean.  
Laughter  may  mask  feelings  of  anger  or  pain,  and  therapists  can  facilitate  clients’  
work in discovering what it could mean for them.
In addition to calling attention to clients’ nonverbal language, the Gestalt thera-
pist  places  emphasis  on  the  relationship  between  language  patterns  and  personal-
ity. Clients’ speech patterns are often an expression of their feelings, thoughts, and 
attitudes. The Gestalt approach focuses on overt speaking habits as a way to increase 
clients’ awareness of themselves, especially by asking them to notice whether their 
words are congruent with what they are experiencing or instead are distancing them 
from their emotions.
Language  can  both  describe  and  conceal.  By  focusing  on  language,  clients  are  
able to increase their awareness of what they are experiencing in the present moment 
and  of  how  they  are  avoiding  coming  into  contact  with  this  here-and-now  experi-
ence.  Here  are  some  examples  of  the  aspects  of  language  that  Gestalt  therapists  
might focus on:
“It” talk. When clients say “it” instead of “I,” they are using depersonal-
izing language. The counselor may ask them to substitute personal pro-
nouns for impersonal ones so that they will assume an increased sense 
of responsibility. For example, if a client says, “It is difficult to make 
friends,” he could be asked to restate this by making an “I” statement: 
“I have trouble making friends.”
“You” talk. Global and impersonal language tends to keep the person hid-
den. The therapist often points out generalized uses of “you” and invites 
the client to experiment with substituting “I” when this is what is meant.
Questions. Questions have a tendency to keep the questioner hidden, 
safe, and unknown. Gestalt therapists often ask clients to experiment 
with changing their questions into statements. In making personal 
statements, clients begin to assume responsibility for what they say. 
They may become aware of how they are keeping themselves mysteri-
ous through a barrage of questions and how this serves to prevent them 
from making declarations that express themselves.

Language that denies power. Some clients have a tendency to deny their 
personal power by adding qualifiers or disclaimers to their statements. 
The therapist may also point out to clients how certain qualifiers sub-
tract from their effectiveness. Experimenting with omitting qualifiers 
such as “maybe,” “perhaps,” “sort of,” “I guess,” “possibly,” and “I sup-
pose” can help clients change ambivalent messages into clear and direct 
statements. Likewise, when clients say “I can’t,” they are really implying 
“I won’t.” Encouraging clients to substitute “won’t” for “can’t” often 
assists them in owning and accepting their power by taking responsi-
bility for their decisions. The therapist must be careful in intervening 
so that clients do not feel that everything they say is subject to scru-
tiny. The therapist hopes to foster awareness of what is really being 
expressed through words, not to scrutinize behavior.
Listening to clients’ metaphors. In his workshops, Erv Polster (1995) 
emphasizes the importance of a therapist learning how to listen to the 
metaphors of clients. By tuning into metaphors, the therapist gets rich 
clues to clients’ internal struggles. Examples of metaphors that can be 
amplified include client statements such as “It’s hard for me to spill 
my guts in here.” “At times I feel that I don’t have a leg to stand on.” “I 
feel like I have a hole in my soul.” “I need to be prepared in case some-
one blasts me.” “I felt ripped to shreds after you confronted me last 
week.” “After this session, I feel as though I’ve been put through a meat 
grinder.” Beneath the metaphor may lie a suppressed internal dialogue 
that represents critical unfinished business or reactions to a present 
interaction. For example, to the client who says she feels that she has 
been put through a meat grinder, the therapist could ask: “What is your 
experience of being ground meat?” or “Who is doing the grinding?” It is 
essential to encourage this client to say more about what she is experi-
encing. The art of therapy consists of assisting clients in translating the 
meaning of their metaphors so that they can be dealt with in therapy.
Listening for language that uncovers a story. Polster (1995) also teaches the 
value of what he calls “fleshing out a flash.” He reports that clients 
often use language that is elusive yet gives significant clues to a story 
that illustrates their life struggles. Effective therapists learn to pick out 
a small part of what someone says and then to focus on and develop 
this element. Clients are likely to slide over pregnant phrases, but the 
alert therapist can ask questions that will help them flesh out their 
story line. It is essential for therapists to pay attention to what is fasci-
nating about the person who is sitting before them and get that person 
to tell a story.
In a workshop I observed Erv Polster’s magnificent style in challenging a person 
(Joe) who had volunteered for a demonstration of an individual session. Although 
Joe had a fascinating story to reveal about a particular facet of his life, he was pre-
senting himself in a lifeless manner, and the energy was going flat. Eventually, Polster 
asked him, “Are you keeping my interest right now? Does it matter to you whether I 
am engaged with you?” Joe looked shocked, but he soon got the point. He accepted

Polster’s challenge to make sure that he not only kept the therapist interested but 
also presented himself in a way to keep those in the audience interested. It was clear 
that Polster was directing Joe’s attention to a process of how he was expressing his 
feelings and life experiences rather than being concerned with what he was talking 
about.
Polster  believes  storytelling  is  not  always  a  form  of  resistance.  Instead,  it  can  
be  the  heart  of  the  therapeutic  process.  He  maintains  that  people  are  storytelling  
beings.  The  therapist’s  task  is  to  assist  clients  in  telling  their  story  in  a  lively  way.  
Polster (1987b) believes many people come to therapy to change the titles of their 
stories rather than to transform their life stories.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
The  general  orientation  of  Gestalt  therapy  is  toward  dialogue,  an  engagement  
between  people  who  each  bring  their  unique  experiences  to  that  meeting  (Yontef  
& Schulz, 2013). Traditional Gestalt therapists assumed that clients must be con-
fronted  about  how  they  avoid  accepting  responsibility,  but  the  dialogic  attitude  
that characterizes contemporary Gestalt therapy creates the ground for a meeting 
place between client and therapist. Other issues that can become the focal point of 
therapy  include  the  client–therapist  relationship  and  the  similarities  in  the  ways  
clients relate to the therapist and to others in their environment.
Gestalt therapists do not make interpretations that explain the dynamics of an 
individual’s behavior or tell a client why he or she is acting in a certain way because 
they  are  not  the  experts  on  the  client’s  experience.  Clients  in  Gestalt  therapy  are  
active  participants  who  make  their  own  interpretations  and  meanings.  It  is  they  
who increase awareness and decide what they will or will not do with their personal 
meaning.
Miriam Polster (1987) described a three-stage integration sequence that charac-
terizes client growth in therapy. The first part of this sequence consists of discovery. 
Clients are likely to reach a new realization about themselves or to acquire a novel 
view of an old situation, or they may take a new look at some significant person in 
their lives. Such discoveries often come as a surprise to them.
The second stage of the integration sequence is accommodation, which involves 
clients’ recognizing that they have a choice. Clients begin by trying out new behav-
iors in the supportive environment of the therapy office, and then they expand their 
awareness of the world. Making new choices is often done awkwardly, but with ther-
apeutic support clients can gain skill in coping with difficult situations. Clients are 
likely to participate in out-of-office experiments, which can be discussed in the next 
therapy session.
The third stage of the integration sequence is assimilation, which involves clients’ 
learning  how  to  influence  their  environment.  At  this  phase  clients  feel  capable  of  
dealing  with  the  surprises  they  encounter  in  everyday  living.  They  are  now  begin-
ning to do more than passively accept the environment. Behavior at this stage may 
include taking a stand on a critical issue. Eventually, clients develop confidence in 
their ability to improve and improvise. Improvisation is the confidence that comes 
from knowledge and skills. Clients are able to make choices that will result in getting 
what  they  want.  The  therapist  points  out  that  something  has  been  accomplished

and acknowledges the changes that have taken place within the client. At this phase 
clients have learned what they can do to maximize their chances of getting what is 
needed from their environment.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
As an existential brand of therapy, Gestalt practice involves a person-to-person rela-
tionship between therapist and client. Therapists are responsible for the quality of 
their presence, for knowing themselves and the client, and for remaining open to the 
client. They are also responsible for establishing and maintaining a therapeutic atmo-
sphere that will foster a spirit of work on the client’s part. It is important that thera-
pists  allow  themselves  to  be  affected  by  their  clients  and  that  they  actively  share  
their own present perceptions and experiences as they encounter clients in the here 
and now. However, therapists need to be thoughtful about when and what to share. 
When a difficulty in a client’s life is being enacted in the therapeutic relationship, 
the therapist invites the client to explore this issue (Wheeler & Axelsson, 2015).
Gestalt therapists not only allow their clients to be who they are but also remain 
themselves and do not get lost in a role. Therapists are expected to encounter clients 
with  honest  and  immediate  reactions,  and  therapists  share  their  personal  experi-
ence and stories in relevant and appropriate ways. Further, they give feedback that 
allows clients to develop an awareness of what they are actually doing. Brown (2007) 
suggests  that  therapists  share  their  reactions  with  clients,  yet  she  also  stresses  the  
importance of demonstrating an attitude of respect, acceptance, present-centeredness, 
and presence.
A number of writers have given central importance to the I/Thou relationship 
and  the  quality  of  the  therapist’s  presence,  as  opposed  to  emphasizing  technical  
skills. They warn of the dangers of becoming technique-bound and losing sight of 
their  own  being  as  they  engage  with  the  client.  Contemporary  relational  Gestalt  
therapy  has  moved  beyond  earlier  (traditional)  therapeutic  practices.  Creating  a  
relationship  (or  alliance)  is  not  a  prelude  to  therapy  but  is  at  the  heart  of  Gestalt  
therapy.  The  therapist’s  attitudes  and  behavior  and  the  relationship  that  is  estab-
lished  are  what  really  count  (Brown,  2007;  Frew,  2013;  Melnick  &  Nevis,  2005;  E.  
Polster,  1987a,  1987b;  M.  Polster,  1987;  Resnick,  2015;  Wheeler  &  Axelsson,  2015;  
Yontef & Jacobs, 2014).
Many  contemporary  Gestalt  therapists  place  increasing  emphasis  on  factors  
such  as  presence,  authentic  dialogue,  gentleness,  more  direct  self-expression  by  
the therapist, decreased use of stereotypic exercises, and greater trust in the client’s 
experiencing.  Laura  Perls  (1976)  stressed  the  notion  that  the  person  of  the  thera-
pist  is  more  important  than  using  techniques.  She  says,  “There  are  as  many  styles  
as  there  are  therapists  and  clients  who  discover  themselves  and  each  other  and  
together  invent  their  relationship”  (p.  223).  A  current  trend  in  Gestalt  practice  is  
toward  greater  emphasis  on  the  client–therapist  relationship,  and  therapists  who  
operate from this orientation are able to establish a present-centered, nonjudgmen-
tal dialogue that allows clients to deepen their awareness and to make contact with 
another person (Jacobs, 1989; Wheeler & Axelsson, 2015).
Polster  and  Polster  (1973)  emphasize  the  importance  of  therapists  knowing  
themselves and being therapeutic instruments. Like artists who need to be in touch

with what they are painting, therapists are artistic participants in the creation of new 
life. The Polsters implore therapists to use their own experiences as essential ingre-
dients  in  the  therapy  process.  According  to  them,  therapists  are  more  than  mere  
responders or catalysts. If they are to make effective contact with clients, therapists 
must be in tune with both their clients and themselves. Therapy is a two-way engage-
ment that changes both the client and the therapist. If therapists are not sensitively 
tuned to their own qualities of tenderness, toughness, and compassion and to their 
reactions  to  the  client,  they  become  technicians.  Experiments  should  be  aimed  at  
awareness, not at simple solutions to a client’s problem.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The Experiment in Gestalt Therapy
Although  the  Gestalt  approach  is  concerned  with  the  obvious,  its  simplicity  
should not be taken to mean that the therapist’s job is easy. Developing a variety 
of interventions is simple, but employing these methods in a mechanical fashion 
allows  clients  to  continue  inauthentic  living.  If  clients  are  to  become  authen-
tic,  they  need  contact  with  an  authentic  therapist.  Gestalt  therapy  methodol-
ogy is tailored to the needs of clients, and experiments are typically presented in 
an invitational manner. Dr. Jon Frew, a Gestalt therapist, demonstrates Gestalt 
interventions applied to the case of Ruth in Case Approach to Counseling and Psycho-
therapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 6).
Before discussing the variety of Gestalt methods you could include in your rep-
ertoire of counseling procedures, it is helpful to differentiate between exercises (or 
techniques)  and  experiments. 
exercises  are  ready-made  techniques  that  are  some-
times  used  to  make  something  happen  in  a  therapy  session  or  to  achieve  a  goal.  
They  can  be  catalysts  for  individual  work  or  for  promoting  interaction  among  
members of a therapy group. 
experiments, in contrast, grow out of the interaction 
between  client  and  therapist,  and  they  emerge  within  this  dialogic  process.  They  
can be considered the very cornerstone of experiential learning. Frew (2013) defines 
the experiment “as a method that shifts the focus of counseling from talking about 
a topic to an activity that will heighten the client’s awareness and understanding 
through experience” (p. 238). According to Melnick and Nevis (2005), experiments 
have been confused with techniques: “A technique is a performed experiment with 
specific learning goals. . . . An experiment, on the other hand, flows directly from 
psychotherapy theory and is crafted to fit the individual as he or she exists in the 
here and now” (p. 108).
In Gestalt therapy, an experiment is an intervention and active technique that 
facilitates  the  collaborative  exploration  of  a  client’s  experience  (Brownell,  2016;  
Yontef & Schulz, 2013). Experiments give people a chance to be systematic in learn-
ing  by  doing  and  are  best  thought  of  as  ways  of  exploring  a  client’s  experiential  
world.  Clients  explore  their  awareness  process  and  discover  how  their  thinking,  
feeling, sensing, and behaving either works for them or does not (Yontef & Schulz, 
2013). “The goal [of an experiment] is always learning—slowing down and deepen-
ing  experience  in  the  service  of  new  understanding  and  new  possibilities  for  more  
flexible and effective response” (Wheeler & Axelsson, 2015, p. 40). Experiences are a

key part of the ongoing dialogue between client and therapist, not a method to fix 
the client or to make the therapy process more exciting (Yontef & Schulz, 2013).
The experiment is fundamental to Gestalt therapy. Zinker (1978) sees therapy 
sessions as a series of experiments, which are the avenues for clients to learn expe-
rientially.  What  is  learned  from  an  experiment  is  a  surprise  to  both  the  client  and  
the  therapist  because  an  experiment  is  an  intentional  entry  into  novel  experience  
aimed at discovery. The most dynamic experiments emerge uniquely from the work 
between  client  and  therapist  (Brownell,  2016).  Gestalt  experiments  are  a  creative  
adventure  and  a  way  in  which  clients  can  express  themselves  behaviorally.  Experi-
ments  are  spontaneous,  one-of-a-kind,  and  relevant  to  a  particular  moment  and  
a  particular  development  of  a  figure-formation  process.  They  are  not  designed  to  
achieve a particular goal but occur in the context of a moment-to-moment contact-
ing process between therapist and client. Polster (1995) indicates that experiments 
are designed by the therapist and evolve from the theme already developing through 
therapeutic engagement, such as the client’s report of needs, dreams, fantasies, and 
body awareness. Experimentation is an attitude inherent in all Gestalt therapy; it is 
a  collaborative  process  with  full  participation  of  the  client.  Clients  test  an  experi-
ment to determine what does and does not fit for them through their own awareness 
(Yontef, 1993, 1995).
Miriam Polster (1987) says that an experiment is a way to bring out some kind 
of internal conflict by making this struggle an actual process. It is aimed at facilitat-
ing a client’s ability to work through the stuck points of his or her life. Experiments 
encourage  spontaneity  and  inventiveness  by  bringing  the  possibilities  for  action  
directly  into  the  therapy  session.  By  dramatizing  or  playing  out  problem  situa-
tions or relationships in the relative safety of the therapy context, clients increase 
their range of flexibility of behavior. According to M. Polster, Gestalt experiments 
can take many forms: imagining a threatening future encounter; setting up a dia-
logue between a client and some significant person in his or her life; dramatizing 
the memory of a painful event; reliving a particularly profound early experience in 
the present; assuming the identity of one’s mother or father through role playing; 
focusing  on  gestures,  posture,  and  other  nonverbal  signs  of  inner  expression;  or  
carrying on a dialogue between two conflicting aspects within the person. Clients 
may  experience  the  feelings  associated  with  their  conflicts  as  experiments  bring  
struggles  to  life  by  inviting  clients  to  enact  them  in  the  present.  It  is  crucial  that  
experiments  be  tailored  to  each  individual  and  used  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  
manner; they also need to be carried out in a context that offers a balance between 
support and risk. Sensitivity and careful attention on the therapist’s part are essen-
tial so that clients are “neither blasted into experiences that are too threatening nor 
allowed to stay in safe but infertile territory” (M. Polster & Polster, 1990, p. 104).
If  students-in-training  limit  their  understanding  of  Gestalt  therapy  to  simply  
reading  about  the  approach,  Gestalt  methods  are  likely  to  seem  abstract  and  the  
notion  of  experiments  may  seem  strange.  Asking  clients  to  “become”  an  object  in  
one of their dreams, for instance, may seem silly and pointless. It is important for 
counselors to personally experience the power of Gestalt experiments and to feel com-
fortable suggesting them to clients. In this regard, it can be most useful for trainees 
to personally experience Gestalt methods as a client.

Preparing Clients for Gestalt Experiments
It is essential that counselors establish a relationship with their clients, so 
that  the  clients  will  feel  trusting  enough  to  participate  in  the  learning  that  can  
result  from  Gestalt  experiments.  Clients  will  get  more  from  Gestalt  experiments  
if  they  are  oriented  and  prepared  for  them.  Through  a  trusting  relationship  with  
the therapist, clients are likely to recognize their resistance and allow themselves to 
participate in these experiments.
If clients are to cooperate, counselors must avoid directing them in a com-
manding fashion to carry out an experiment. Typically, I ask clients if they are 
willing to try out an experiment to see what they might learn from it. I also tell 
clients that they can stop when they choose to, so the power is with them. Clients 
at times say that they feel silly or self-conscious or that the task feels artificial or 
unreal. At such times I am likely to respond by asking, “Are you willing to give 
it a try and see what happens?” The way in which clients resist doing an experi-
ment  reveals  a  great  deal  about  their  personality  and  their  way  of  being  in  the  
world.  Gestalt  therapists  expect  and  respect  the  emergence  of  reluctance  and  
meet clients wherever they are. Gestalt experiments work best when the therapist 
is respectful of the client’s cultural background and has a solid working alliance 
with the person. Clients with a long history of containing their feelings may be 
reluctant to participate in experiments that are likely to bring their emotions to 
the surface.
Contemporary  Gestalt  therapy  places  much  less  emphasis  on  resistance  than  
the early version of Gestalt therapy. Although it is possible to look at “resistance to 
awareness” and “resistance to contact,” the idea of resistance is viewed as unneces-
sary by some Gestalt therapists. Frew (2013) argues that the notion of resistance is 
completely foreign to the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy and suggests that 
resistance is a term frequently used for clients who are not doing what the therapist 
wants them to do. Polster and Polster (1976) suggest that it is best for therapists to 
observe what is actually and presently happening rather than trying to make some-
thing  happen.  This  gets  away  from  the  notion  that  clients  are  resisting  and  thus  
behaving  wrongly.  According  to  the  Polsters,  change  occurs  through  contact  and  
awareness—one does not have to try to change. Maurer (2005) writes about “appre-
ciating resistance” as a creative adjustment to a situation rather than something to 
overcome.  Maurer  claims  that  we  need  to  respect  resistance,  take  it  seriously,  and  
view it as “the energy” and not “the enemy.”
It is well to remember that Gestalt experiments are designed to expand cli-
ents’  awareness  and  to  help  them  try  out  new  modes  of  behavior.  Within  the  
safety of the therapeutic situation, clients are given opportunities and encour-
aged  to  “try  on”  a  new  behavior.  An  experimental  attitude  in  the  therapeutic  
process involves the client’s input and allows what emerges between client and 
therapist  to  guide  the  direction  of  the  therapy  (Yontef  &  Schulz,  2013).  This  
heightens  the  awareness  of  a  particular  aspect  of  functioning,  which  leads  to  
increased   self-understanding   (Breshgold,   1989;   Yontef,   1995).   Experiments   
are  only  means  to  the  end  of  helping  people  become  more  aware  and  making  
changes they most desire.

The Role of Confrontation
Students are sometimes put off by their perception that a Gestalt counselor’s 
style is direct and confrontational. I tell my students that it is a mistake to equate 
the practice of any theory with its founder. In the workshops that Fritz Perls gave, 
people often found him harshly confrontational and saw him as meeting his own 
needs through showmanship. Yontef (1993) refers to the traditional Perlsian style as 
a  “boom-boom-boom  therapy”  characterized  by  theatrics,  abrasive  confrontation,  
and intense catharsis. Yontef (1993, 1999) is critical of the anti-intellectual, individ-
ualistic, dramatic, and confrontational flavor that characterized traditional Gestalt 
therapy in the “anything goes environment” of the 1960s and 1970s.
The contemporary practice of Gestalt therapy has progressed beyond this style. 
According  to  Yontef  (1999),  contemporary  relational  Gestalt  therapy  has  evolved  
to  include  more  support  and  increased  kindness  and  compassion  in  therapy.  This  
approach  “combines  sustained  empathic  inquiry  with  crisp,  clear,  and  relevant  
awareness  focusing”  (p.  10).  Perls  practiced  a  highly  confrontational  approach  as  
a way to deal with avoidance, but this technique-focused style of working has given 
way  to  a  more  dialogue-centered  methodology  today  (Bowman,  2005;  Frew,  2013;  
Yontef & Jacobs, 2014; Yontef & Schulz, 2013).
In contemporary Gestalt therapy, confrontation is set up in a way that invites 
clients to examine their behaviors, attitudes, and thoughts. Therapists can encour-
age clients to look at certain incongruities, especially gaps between their verbal and 
nonverbal  expression.  Further,  confrontation  does  not  have  to  be  aimed  at  weak-
nesses or negative traits; clients can be challenged to recognize how they are block-
ing their strengths.
Therapists who care enough to make demands on their clients are telling them, 
in effect, that they could be in fuller contact with themselves and others. Ultimately, 
however, clients must decide for themselves if they want to accept this invitation to 
learn  more  about  themselves.  This  caveat  needs  to  be  kept  in  mind  with  all  of  the  
experiments that are to be described.
Gestalt Therapy Interventions
Exercises  are  preplanned  activities  that  can  be  used  to  elicit  emotion,  pro-
duce action, or achieve a specific goal. Experiments, in contrast, are spontaneously 
created to fit what is happening in the therapeutic process and can be useful tools 
to  help  clients  gain  fuller  awareness,  experience  internal  conflicts,  resolve  incon-
sistencies  and  dichotomies,  and  work  through  impasses  that  prevent  completion  
of unfinished business (Conyne, 2015). Some therapists operate on the erroneous 
assumption that the practice of Gestalt therapy consists of a bag of techniques that 
define  the  therapy,  but  as  Resnick  (2015)  states,  techniques  and  exercises  are  the  
least important part of Gestalt therapy.
The techniques described here neither define Gestalt therapy nor are they a nec-
essary  part  of  Gestalt  practice.  When  used  at  their  best,  these  interventions  fit  the  
therapeutic situation and highlight whatever the client is experiencing. The follow-
ing material is based on Levitsky and Perls (1970), with my own suggestions added 
for implementing these methods.

The  Internal  Dialogue  Exercise  One  goal  of  Gestalt  therapy  is  to  bring  about  
integrated functioning and acceptance of aspects of one’s personality that have been 
disowned and denied. Gestalt therapists pay close attention to splits in personality 
function. A main division is between the “top dog” and the “underdog,” and therapy 
often focuses on the war between the two.
The  top  dog  is  righteous,  authoritarian,  moralistic,  demanding,  bossy,  and  
manipulative. This is the “critical parent” that badgers with “shoulds” and “oughts” 
and manipulates with threats of catastrophe. The underdog manipulates by playing 
the role of victim: by being defensive, apologetic, helpless, and weak and by feigning 
powerlessness. This is the passive side, the one without responsibility, and the one 
that finds excuses.
The top dog and the underdog are engaged in a constant struggle for control. 
The  struggle  helps  to  explain  why  one’s  resolutions  and  promises  often  go  unful-
filled and why one’s procrastination persists. The tyrannical top dog demands that 
one  be  thus-and-so,  whereas  the  underdog  defiantly  plays  the  role  of  disobedient  
child.  As  a  result  of  this  struggle  for  control,  the  individual  becomes  fragmented  
into controller and controlled. The civil war between the two sides continues, with 
both sides fighting for their existence.
The conflict between the two opposing poles in the personality is rooted in the 
mechanism  of  introjection,  which  involves  incorporating  aspects  of  others,  usu-
ally parents, into one’s personality. It is essential that clients become aware of their 
introjects, especially the toxic introjects that poison the person and prevent person-
ality integration.
The Empty-Chair Technique Jacob Moreno, the founder of psychodrama, originated 
the  empty-chair  technique,  which  was  later  incorporated  into  Gestalt  therapy  by  
Perls.  The  empty  chair  is  a  vehicle  for  the  technique  of  role  reversal,  which  is  useful  
in  bringing  into  consciousness  the  fantasies  of  what  the  “other”  might  be  thinking  
or feeling. Essentially, this is a role-playing technique in which all the parts are played 
by  the  client.  In  this  way  the  introjects  can  surface,  and  the  client  can  experience  the  
conflict more fully. There are many applications for this technique. One of the more 
important  uses  is  to  explore  what  another  person  in  one’s  social  network  might  be  
feeling, and what that person’s more realistic predicament might be.
Using two chairs, the therapist asks the client to sit in one chair and be fully the 
top dog and then shift to the other chair and become the underdog. The dialogue 
can  continue  between  both  sides  of  the  client.  The  conflict  can  be  resolved  by  the  
client’s  acceptance  and  integration  of  both  sides.  This  exercise  helps  clients  get  in  
touch with a feeling or a side of themselves that they may be denying; rather than 
merely talking about a conflicted feeling, they intensify the feeling and experience 
it fully. Further, by helping clients realize that the feeling is a very real part of them-
selves, the intervention discourages clients from disassociating the feeling. The goal 
of this exercise is to promote a higher level of integration between the polarities and 
conflicts that exist in everyone. The aim is not to rid oneself of certain traits but to 
learn to accept and live with the polarities.
Future   Projection   Technique   In   future   projection,   an   anticipated   event   is   
brought into the present moment and acted out. This technique, often associated

with psychodrama, is designed to help clients express and clarify concerns they have 
about  the  future.  These  concerns  may  include  wishes  and  hopes,  dreaded  fears  of  
tomorrow, or goals that provide some direction to life. A client creates a future time 
and  place  with  selected  people,  brings  this  event  into  the  present,  and  gets  a  new  
perspective on a problem. Clients may act out either a version of the way they hope a 
given situation will ideally unfold or their version of a feared outcome. Once clients 
clarify  their  hopes  for  a  particular  outcome,  they  are  in  a  better  position  to  take  
specific steps that will enable them to achieve the future they desire.
Making the Rounds Making the rounds is a Gestalt exercise that involves asking 
a  person  in  a  group  to  go  up  to  others  in  the  group  and  either  speak  to  or  do  
something with each person. The purpose is to confront, to risk, to disclose the self, 
to experiment with new behavior, and to grow and change. I have experimented with 
“making the rounds” when I sensed that a participant needed to face each person 
in the group with some theme. For example, a group member might say: “I’ve been 
sitting  here  for  a  long  time  wanting  to  participate  but  holding  back  because  I’m  
afraid of trusting people in here. And besides, I don’t think I’m worth the time of 
the  group  anyway.”  I  might  counter  with  “Are  you  willing  to  do  something  right  
now to get yourself more invested and to begin to work on gaining trust and self-
confidence?” If the person answers affirmatively, my suggestion could well be, “Go 
around to each person and finish this sentence: ‘I don’t trust you because . . .
 ’.” Any 
number  of  exercises  could  be  invented  to  help  individuals  involve  themselves  and  
choose to work on the things that keep them frozen in fear.
Some  other  related  illustrations  and  examples  that  I  find  appropriate  for  the  
making-the-rounds  intervention  are  reflected  in  clients’  comments  such  as  these:  
“I  would  like  to  reach  out  to  people  more  often.”  “Nobody  in  here  seems  to  care  
very much.” “I’d like to make contact with you, but I’m afraid of being rejected [or 
accepted].” “It’s hard for me to accept compliments; I always discount good things 
people say to me.”
The Reversal Exercise Certain symptoms and behaviors often represent reversals 
of  underlying  or  latent  impulses.  Thus,  the  therapist  could  ask  a  person  who  
claims to suffer from severe inhibitions and excessive timidity to play the role of an 
exhibitionist. I remember a client in one of our therapy groups who had difficulty 
being  anything  but  sugary  sweet.  I  asked  her  to  reverse  her  typical  style  and  be  as  
negative  as  she  could  be.  The  reversal  worked  well;  soon  she  was  playing  her  part  
with real gusto, and later she was able to recognize and accept her “negative side” as 
well as her “positive side.”
The theory underlying the reversal technique is that clients take the plunge into 
the  very  thing  that  is  fraught  with  anxiety  and  make  contact  with  those  parts  of  
themselves  that  have  been  submerged  and  denied.  This  technique  can  help  clients  
begin to accept certain personal attributes that they have tried to deny.
The Rehearsal Exercise Oftentimes we get stuck rehearsing silently to ourselves 
so that we will gain acceptance. When it comes to the performance, we experience 
stage fright, or anxiety, because we fear that we will not play our role well. Internal 
rehearsal  consumes  much  energy  and  frequently  inhibits  our  spontaneity  and

willingness  to  experiment  with  new  behavior.  When  clients  share  their  rehearsals  
out loud with a therapist, they become more aware of the many preparatory means 
they  use  in  bolstering  their  social  roles.  They  also  become  increasingly  aware  of  
how they try to meet the expectations of others, of the degree to which they want 
to  be  approved,  accepted,  and  liked,  and  of  the  extent  to  which  they  go  to  attain  
acceptance.
The Exaggeration Exercise One aim of Gestalt therapy is for clients to become 
more aware of the subtle signals and cues they are sending through body language. 
Movements,  postures,  and  gestures  may  communicate  significant  meanings,  yet  
the  cues  may  be  incomplete.  In  this  exercise  the  person  is  asked  to  exaggerate  the  
movement  or  gesture  repeatedly,  which  usually  intensifies  the  feeling  attached  to  
the  behavior  and  makes  the  inner  meaning  clearer.  Some  examples  of  behaviors  
that lend themselves to the exaggeration technique are trembling (shaking hands, 
legs),  slouched  posture  and  bent  shoulders,  clenched  fists,  tight  frowning,  facial  
grimacing,  crossed  arms,  and  so  forth.  If  a  client  reports  that  his  or  her  legs  are  
shaking,  the  therapist  may  ask  the  client  to  stand  up  and  exaggerate  the  shaking.  
Then the therapist may ask the client to put words to the shaking limbs.
Staying With the Feeling Most people want to escape from fearful stimuli and 
avoid unpleasant feelings. At key moments when clients refer to a feeling or a mood 
that  is  unpleasant  and  from  which  they  have  a  great  desire  to  flee,  the  therapist  
may  urge  clients  to  stay  with  their  feeling  and  encourage  them  to  go  deeper  into  
the  feeling  or  behavior  they  wish  to  avoid.  Facing  and  experiencing  feelings  not  
only takes courage but also is a mark of a willingness to endure the pain necessary 
for  unblocking  and  making  way  for  newer  levels  of  growth.  A  strong  therapeutic  
relationship built on trust and nonjudgmental acceptance fosters the safety needed 
for clients to stay with these unpleasant feelings.
The Gestalt Approach to Dream Work In psychoanalysis dreams are interpreted, 
intellectual insight is stressed, and free association is used to explore the unconscious 
meanings of dreams. The Gestalt approach does not interpret and analyze dreams. 
Instead, the intent is to bring dreams back to life and relive them as though they were 
happening now. The dream is acted out in the present, and the dreamer becomes a 
part of his or her dream. The suggested format for working with dreams includes 
making a list of all the details of the dream, remembering each person, event, and 
mood in it, and then becoming each of these parts by transforming oneself, acting 
as  fully  as  possible  and  inventing  dialogue.  Each  part  of  the  dream  is  assumed  to  
be a projection of the self, and the client creates scripts for encounters between the 
various characters or parts. All of the different parts of a dream are expressions of 
the  client’s  own  contradictory  and  inconsistent  sides.  By  engaging  in  a  dialogue  
between these opposing sides, the client gradually becomes more aware of the range 
of his or her own feelings.
Perls’s concept of projection is central in his theory of dream formation; every 
person and every object in the dream represents a projected aspect of the dreamer. 
Perls (1969a) suggested that “we start with the impossible assumption that whatever 
we believe we see in another person or in the world is nothing but a projection”

(p. 67). Recognizing the senses and understanding projections go hand in hand. Cli-
ents do not think about or analyze the dream but use it as a script and experiment 
with the dialogue among the various parts of the dream. Because clients can act out 
a fight between opposing sides, eventually they can appreciate and accept their inner 
differences and integrate the opposing forces. Freud called the dream the royal road 
to the unconscious, but to Perls dreams are the “royal road to integration” (p. 66).
According to Perls, the dream is the most spontaneous expression of the exis-
tence  of  the  human  being.  It  represents  an  unfinished  situation,  but  every  dream  
also  contains  an  existential  message  regarding  oneself  and  one’s  current  struggle.  
Everything can be found in dreams if all the parts are understood and assimilated; 
dreams serve as an excellent way to discover personality voids by revealing missing 
parts  and  clients’  methods  of  avoidance.  Perls  asserts  that  if  dreams  are  properly  
worked  with,  the  existential  message  becomes  clearer.  If  people  do  not  remember  
dreams, they may be refusing to face what is wrong with their life. At the very least, 
the Gestalt counselor asks clients to talk to their missing dreams. For example, as 
directed by her therapist, a client reported the following dream in the present tense, 
as though she were still dreaming:
I  have  three  monkeys  in  a  cage.  One  big  monkey  and  two  little  ones!  I  feel  very  
attached to these monkeys, although they are creating a lot of chaos in a cage that 
is divided into three separate spaces. They are fighting with one another—the big 
monkey is fighting with the little monkey. They are getting out of the cage, and 
they  are  clinging  onto  me.  I  feel  like  pushing  them  away  from  me.  I  feel  totally  
overwhelmed by the chaos that they are creating around me. I turn to my mother 
and tell her that I need help, that I can no longer handle these monkeys because 
they are driving me crazy. I feel very sad and very tired, and I feel discouraged. I am 
walking away from the cage, thinking that I really love these monkeys, yet I have 
to get rid of them. I am telling myself that I am like everybody else. I get pets, and 
then  when  things  get  rough,  I  want  to  get  rid  of  them.  I  am  trying  very  hard  to  
find a solution to keeping these monkeys and not allowing them to have such a 
terrible effect on me. Before I wake up from my dream, I am making the decision 
to put each monkey in a separate cage, and maybe that is the way to keep them.
The therapist then asked his client, Brenda, to “become” different parts of her 
dream.  Thus,  she  became  the  cage,  and  she  became  and  had  a  dialogue  with  each  
monkey,  and  then  she  became  her  mother,  and  so  forth.  One  of  the  most  power-
ful  aspects  of  this  technique  was  Brenda’s  reporting  her  dream  as  though  it  were  
still happening. She quickly perceived that her dream expressed a struggle she was 
having  with  her  husband  and  her  two  children.  From  her  dialogue  work,  Brenda  
discovered that she both appreciated and resented her family. She learned that she 
needed to let them know about her feelings and that together they might work on 
improving  an  intensely  difficult  lifestyle.  She  did  not  need  an  interpretation  from  
her therapist to understand the clear message of her dream.
Application to Group Counseling
As  a  therapeutic  orientation  based  on  field  theory,  Gestalt  therapy  is  well  
suited for a group context. A main goal of the Gestalt group is to heighten aware-
ness  and  self-regulation  through  interactions  with  one  another  and  the  group

itself  (Conyne,  2015).  Gestalt  therapy  encourages  direct  experience  and  actions  as  
opposed to merely talking about conflicts, problems, and feelings. If members have 
anxieties pertaining to some future event, they can enact these future concerns in 
the  present.  This  here-and-now  focus  enlivens  the  group  and  assists  members  in  
vividly exploring their concerns. Moving from talking about to action is often done 
by the use of experiments in a group. Gestalt therapy employs a rich variety of inter-
ventions designed to intensify what group members are directly experiencing in the 
present moment for the purpose of leading to increased awareness. Gestalt group 
therapists attend to matters such as verbal and nonverbal language, postures, voice, 
interpersonal interactions, and group processes (Conyne, 2015).
When one member is the focus of work, other members can be used to enhance 
an individual’s work. Through the skill of linking, the group leader can bring a num-
ber  of  members  into  the  exploration  of  a  problem.  I  prefer  an  interactive  style  of  
Gestalt group work and find that bringing in an interpersonal dimension maximizes 
the therapeutic potency within the group. I do not like to introduce a technique to 
promote something happening within a group; rather, I tend to invite members to 
try out different behavioral styles as a way to heighten what a given member might 
be experiencing at the moment. A group format provides a context for a great deal 
of  creativity  in  using  interventions  and  designing  experiments.  These  experiments  
need to be tailored to each group member and used in a timely manner; they also 
need to be carried out in a context that offers a balance between support and risk. 
Experiments, at their best, evolve from what is going on within individual members 
and what is happening in the group at the moment.
Although  Gestalt  group  leaders  encourage  members  to  heighten  their  aware-
ness and attend to their interpersonal style of relating, leaders tend to take an active 
role in creating experiments to help members tap their resources. Gestalt leaders are 
actively engaged with the members, and leaders frequently engage in self-disclosure 
as a way to enhance relationships and create a sense of mutuality within the group. 
Gestalt leaders are especially concerned with awareness, contact, and experimenta-
tion (Yontef & Jacobs, 2014).
If members experience the group as being a safe place, they will be inclined to 
move  into  the  unknown  and  challenge  themselves.  To  increase  the  chances  that  
members  will  benefit  from  Gestalt  methods,  group  leaders  need  to  communicate  
the general purpose of these interventions and create an experimental climate. Lead-
ers are not trying to push an agenda; rather, members are free to try something new 
and determine for themselves the outcomes of an experiment.
In training workshops in group counseling that Marianne Schneider Corey and 
I conducted in Korea, the Gestalt approach was well accepted. Group members were 
very open and willing to share themselves emotionally once a climate of safety was 
created. Adopting the stance of phenomenological inquiry, we strive to avoid mak-
ing assumptions about the members of a group, and we are careful not to impose 
our worldviews or values on them. Instead, we approach clients with respect, inter-
est, compassion, and presence. We work collaboratively with our clients to discover 
how  to  best  help  them  resolve  the  difficulties  they  experience  internally,  interper-
sonally, and in the context of their social environment. Although it is unrealistic to 
think you need to know everything about different cultures, it is essential to bring an 
attitude of respect and appreciation for differences to your work in diverse cultural

environments around the world. With these attitudes we found that we were able to 
use many Gestalt interventions with Korean people in a group training context. In 
some ways this is not surprising because in Korea there is an emphasis on collectiv-
istic values, and group work fits well into the Korean culture.

Gestalt Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
There  are  opportunities  to  creatively  use  Gestalt  methods  with  culturally  
diverse  populations  if  interventions  are  timed  appropriately  and  used  flexibly.  
Frew (2013) notes that contemporary Gestalt therapy can be a useful and effective 
approach with clients from diverse backgrounds because it takes the clients’ context 
into account. One of the advantages of drawing on Gestalt experiments is that they 
can be tailored to fit the unique way in which an individual perceives and interprets 
his  or  her  culture.  Although  most  therapists  have  preconceptions,  Gestalt  thera-
pists strive to approach each client in an open way. By bracketing their own values, 
Gestalt therapists remaining receptive to how clients’ realities differ from their own. 
They do this by checking out their biases and views in dialogue with the client. This 
is particularly important in working with individuals from other cultures.
Fernbacher and Plummer (2005) stress the importance of assisting Gestalt ther-
apy  trainees  in  developing  their  own  awareness  and  contend:  “to  undertake  work  
across  cultures  from  a  Gestalt  perspective,  it  is  essential  that  we  explore  our  own  
cultural  selves  .  .  .  to  make  contact  and  encourage  contact  in  and  with  others,  we  
need to know about ourselves” (p. 131).
Gestalt  therapy  is  particularly  effective  in  helping  people  integrate  the  polari-
ties  within  themselves.  Many  bicultural  clients  experience  an  ongoing  struggle  to  
reconcile what appears to be diverse aspects of the two cultures in which they live. 
In one of my weeklong groups, a dynamic piece of work was done by a woman with 
European  roots.  Her  struggle  consisted  of  integrating  her  American  side  with  her  
experiences in Germany as a child. I suggested that she “bring her family into this 
group” by talking to selected members in the group as though they were members of 
her family. I invited her to imagine that she was 8 years old and that she could now 
say to her parents and siblings things that she had never expressed. She was asked to 
speak in German (because this was her primary language as a child). The combined 
factors of her trust in the group, her willingness to re-create an early scene by reliving 
it in the present moment, and her symbolic work with fantasy helped her achieve a 
significant breakthrough. She was able to put a new ending to an old and unfinished 
situation through her participation in this Gestalt experiment.
There  are  many  opportunities  to  apply  Gestalt  experiments  in  creative  ways  
with diverse client populations. In cultures where indirect speech is the norm, non-
verbal  behaviors  may  emphasize  the  unspoken  content  of  verbal  communication.  
These  clients  may  express  themselves  nonverbally  more  expressively  than  they  do  
with words. Gestalt therapists typically ask clients to focus on their gestures, facial 
expressions, and what they are experiencing within their own body. They attempt to

fully understand the background of their clients’ culture. They are concerned about 
which  aspects  of  this  background  become  central  or  figural  for  their  clients  and  
what meaning clients place on these figures.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
To a greater extent than is true of most other approaches, there are some potential 
problems  in  too  quickly  utilizing  Gestalt  experiments  with  some  clients.  Gestalt  
methods can lead to a high level of intense feelings. This focus on affect has clear 
limitations with those clients who have been culturally conditioned to be emotion-
ally  reserved  and  to  avoid  openly  expressing  feelings.  As  mentioned  earlier,  some  
individuals  believe  expressing  feelings  openly  is  a  sign  of  weakness  and  a  display  
of one’s vulnerability. Therapists who operate on the assumption that catharsis is 
necessary for any change to occur are likely to find certain clients becoming increas-
ingly  reluctant  to  participate  in  experiments,  and  such  clients  may  prematurely  
terminate counseling. Other individuals have strong cultural injunctions prohibit-
ing them from directly expressing their emotions to their parents (such as “Never 
show  your  parents  that  you  are  angry  at  them”  or  “Strive  for  peace  and  harmony,  
and avoid conflicts”). I recall a client from India who was asked by his counselor to 
“bring  your  father  into  the  room.”  The  client  was  very  reluctant  to  even  symboli-
cally tell his father of his disappointment with their relationship. In his culture the 
accepted way to deal with his father was to use his uncle as a go-between, and it was 
considered highly inappropriate to express any negative feelings toward his father. 
The client later said that he would have felt very guilty if he had symbolically told 
his father what he sometimes thought and felt.
Gestalt therapists who have truly integrated their approach are sensitive enough 
to  practice  in  a  flexible  way.  They  consider  the  client’s  cultural  framework  and  are  
able  to  adapt  methods  that  are  likely  to  be  well  received.  They  strive  to  help  clients  
experience themselves as fully as possible in the present, yet they are not rigidly bound 
by dictates, nor do they routinely intervene whenever clients stray from the present. 
Sensitively staying in contact with a client’s flow of experiencing entails the ability to 
focus on the person and not on the mechanical use of techniques for a certain effect.
G
estalt-oriented therapy focuses on the unfinished 
business Stan has with his parents, siblings, and 
ex-wife.  It  appears  that  this  unfinished  business  con-
sists mainly of feelings of resentment, and Stan turns 
this  resentment  on  himself.  His  present  life  situation  
is  spotlighted,  but  he  may  also  need  to  reexperience  
past feelings that could be interfering with his present 
attempts to develop intimacy with others.
Although the focus is on Stan’s present behavior, 
I guide him toward becoming aware of how he is car-
rying  old  baggage  around  and  how  it  interferes  with  
his  life  today.  My  task  is  to  assist  him  in  re-creating  
the context in which he made creative adjustments dur-
ing his childhood years that are no longer serving him 
well. One of his cardinal introjections was, “I’m stupid, 
and it would be better if I did not exist.”
Stan  has  been  influenced  by  cultural  messages  
that he has accepted. I am interested in exploring his 
cultural  background,  including  his  values  and  the  
values  characteristic  of  his  culture.  With  this  focus,  I  
assist  Stan  in  identifying  some  of  the  following  cul-
tural introjections: “Don’t talk about your family with

this  perspective.  This  session  consists  of  stan  
exploring one of his dreams in Gestalt fashion.
strangers, and don’t hang your dirty linen in public.” 
“Don’t  confront  your  parents  because  they  deserve  
respect.”  “Don’t  be  too  concerned  about  yourself.”  
“Don’t   show   your   vulnerabilities;   hide   your   feel-
ings  and  weaknesses.”  I  invite  Stan  to  examine  those  
introjections  to  assess  their  utility  in  his  present  cir-
cumstances.  Although  he  can  decide  to  retain  those  
aspects  of  his  culture  that  he  prizes,  he  is  in  a  posi-
tion to modify or reject other cultural expectations. Of 
course,  this  will  be  done  when  these  issues  emerge  in  
the foreground of his work.
I  ask  Stan  to  attend  to  what  he  becomes  aware  
of  as  the  session  begins:  “What  are  you  experiencing  
as  we  are  getting  started  today?”  As  I  encourage  Stan  
to  tune  in  to  his  present  experience  and  selectively  
make  observations,  a  number  of  figures  will  emerge.  
The  goal  is  to  focus  on  a  figure  of  interest,  one  that  
seems  to  hold  the  most  energy  or  relevance  for  Stan.  
When a figure is identified, my task is to deepen Stan’s 
awareness of this thought, feeling, body sensation, or 
insight through related experiments.
In typical Gestalt fashion, Stan deals with his pres-
ent struggles within the context of our relationship and 
through   experimentation.   One   possible   experiment   
would  involve  Stan  becoming  some  of  those  individu-
als  who  told  him  how  to  think,  feel,  and  behave  as  a  
child.  He  can  then  become  the  child  that  he  was  and  
respond to them from the place where he feels the most 
confusion or pain. He experiences in new ways the feel-
ings  that  accompany  his  beliefs  about  himself,  and  he  
comes to a deeper appreciation of how his feelings and 
thoughts influence what he is doing today.
Stan has learned to hide his emotions rather than to 
reveal them. Understanding this about him, we explore 
his  objections  and  concerns  about  “getting  into  feel-
ings.” The figure of interest now is his hesitation to expe-
rience  or  express  emotion.  Although  I  have  no  agenda  
to  get  Stan  to  experience  his  feelings  at  this  point,  it  is  
important for him to increase his awareness of his reluc-
tance and to explore the meaning it holds for him.
If  Stan  decides  that  he  wants  to  experience  his  
emotions  rather  than  deny  them,  I  ask:  “What  are  you  
aware of now having said what you did?” Stan says that 
he  can’t  get  his  ex-wife  out  of  his  mind.  He  tells  me  
about  the  pain  he  feels  over  that  relationship  and  how  
he is frightened of getting involved again lest he be hurt 
again.  I  continue  to  ask  him  to  focus  inward  and  get  a  
sense  of  what  stands  out  for  him  at  this  very  moment.  
Stan  replies:  “I’m  hurt  and  angry  over  all  the  pain  that  
I’ve allowed her to inflict on me.” I ask him to imagine 
himself in earlier scenes with his ex-wife, as though the 
painful  situation  were  occurring  in  the  here  and  now.  
He  symbolically  relives  and  reexperiences  the  situation  
by talking “directly” to his wife. By expressing his resent-
ments  and  hurts  directly,  Stan  can  begin  to  complete  
some  unfinished  business  that  is  interfering  with  his  
current functioning. By participating in this experiment, 
Stan is attaining more awareness of what he is now doing 
and how he keeps himself locked into his past.
Questions for Reflection
How might you begin a session with Stan? Would 
you suggest a direction he should pursue? Would 
you wait for him to initiate work? Would you 
ask him to continue from where he left off in the 
previous session? Would you attend to whatever 
theme or issue becomes figural to him?
What unfinished business can you identify in 
Stan’s case? Does any of his experience of being 
stuck remind you of yourself? How might you 
work with Stan if he did bring up your own unfin-
ished business?
What kind of an experiment might you propose to 
assist Stan in learning more about his hesitation 
and reluctance to access and express his feelings?
Stan participated in an experiment to deal with 
pain, resentment, and hurt over situations with 
his ex-wife. How might you have worked with the 
material Stan brought up? What kind of experi-
ment might you design? How would you decide 
what kind of experiment to create?
How might you work with Stan’s cultural mes-
sages? Would you be able to respect his cultural 
values and still encourage him to make an assess-
ment of some of the ways in which his culture is 
affecting him today?

rom a Gestalt perspective, I am interested in assist-
ing Gwen in becoming more aware of herself as a 
whole  person  in  the  here  and  now.  My  job  is  to  hold  
a mirror up and help her see herself with greater clar-
ity.  I  notice  that  Gwen  has  a  slight  limp  as  she  walks  
into  my  office.  I  ask  about  her  limp,  and  Gwen  tells  
me she has had a great deal of pain in her left hip for 
the  past  week.  She  explains  that  she  has  had  trouble  
with her hip before and that an MRI revealed negative 
results. She goes on to say that it may be due to their 
old mattress.
Therapist:
 Describe exactly where the pain is and what 
the sensations feel like.
Gwen: Well, it feels uncomfortable in the crease of 
my hip, and it’s a dull sore feeling.
Therapist: Describe the texture and color of the feel-
ing in your hip [asking her to make contact with her 
bodily sensations].
Gwen: The pain is prickly, gray, and heavy [she begins to 
connect with her body in the moment].
Therapist: What is that hip saying to you?
Gwen: This seems a bit strange, and I must admit I am 
uncomfortable in giving my hip a voice.
Therapist: Although it may seem strange, I hope you 
will give it a try to see what you might learn from 
doing this. You can always stop when you think 
that doing this is not helpful.
Gwen: OK, this is uncomfortable, but I will give it a 
try [she has trust in our relationship]. This hip is moan-
ing and groaning!
Therapist:  [An experiment may increase this connection.] 
This may feel a little weird, but try to become  
your hip and exaggerate how your hip is  
feeling.
Gwen:  [Begins to groan and whimper and tears come to 
her eyes] I am so tired of the mountain of things I 
have to do and never getting anywhere. I feel like 
a fallen tree in the forest. I have fallen and no one 
knows I am there and it is up to me to get up and 
get going again.
In  her  daily  life  Gwen  typically  holds  back  her  true  
feelings.  She  is  used  to  suppressing  her  irritations  
and  even  her  triumphs.  Because  she  was  frequently  
ignored  as  a  child,  she  feels  that  her  thoughts  and  
emotions  don’t  really  matter.  Her  role  at  work  is  to  
solve  problems,  and  at  home  she  is  the  caretaker  of  
everyone.  She  rarely  allows  herself  to  be  vulnerable  
or fully human. Gwen sees herself as “in charge” and 
seldom gives herself a moment to pause or catch her 
breath.
Gwen:
 I know that basically I have a good life, I just 
rush past the good stuff and forget to stop and re-
ally appreciate all the blessings. I can get so caught 
up in what I have not done or what feels wrong, but 
I can’t really complain. I know this hip is telling 
me to slow down and enjoy more of my life. I don’t 
have to be that fallen tree, I just need to ask for 
the support I really need [her body has shifted and she 
seems more relaxed in her chair].
Therapist: Bring your attention back to your hip. 
What does it feel like now?
Gwen: It feels better now. It might be OK to slow 
down. It might even be OK to take myself off of 
some of these committees I am on. [Laughing]  
Maybe my hip just needs to sit on a beach some-
where or at least slow down enough to have some 
fun.
Therapist: It is important for you to stop for a mo-
ment and check in with your body. We hold our 
emotions in our bodies. It’s important to take time 
out to listen to what the sensations in our body 
may be telling us.
As  Gwen’s  awareness  increases,  she  is  beginning  
to realize some of her past ways of functioning are no 
longer serving her and she can begin to do something 
differently.  It  is  my  hope  that  Gwen  can  now  see  the

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Gestalt therapy is an experiential approach that stresses present awareness and 
the quality of contact between the individual and the environment. The major 
focus is on assisting the client to become aware of how behaviors that were once 
part of creatively adjusting to past environments may be interfering with effec-
tive functioning and living in the present. The goal of the approach is, first and 
foremost, to gain awareness.
Another therapeutic aim is to assist clients in exploring how they make con-
tact with elements of their environment. Change occurs through the heightened 
awareness  of  “what  is.”  Because  the  Gestalt  therapist  has  no  agenda  beyond  
assisting  clients  to  increase  their  awareness,  there  is  no  need  to  label  a  client’s  
behavior as “resistance.” Instead, the therapist simply follows this new process 
as it emerges. The therapist has faith that self-regulation is a naturally unfolding 
process that does not have to be controlled (Breshgold, 1989). Awareness is a key 
requirement  for  the  restoration  of  self-regulation  within  the  person’s  environ-
ment  (Resnick,  2015).  With  expanded  awareness,  clients  are  able  to  reconcile  
polarities and dichotomies within themselves and proceed toward the reintegra-
tion of all aspects of themselves.
The therapist works with the client to identify the figures, or most salient 
aspects of the individual–environmental field, as they emerge from the back-
ground. The Gestalt therapist believes each client is capable of self-regulating 
if those figures are engaged and resolved so others can replace them. The role 
of  the  Gestalt  therapist  is  to  help  clients  identify  the  most  pressing  issues,  
needs,  and  interests  and  to  design  experiments  that  sharpen  those  figures  
or  that  explore  resistances  to  contact  and  awareness.  Gestalt  therapists  are  
encouraged  to  be  appropriately  self-disclosing,  both  about  their  here-and-
now reactions in the therapy hour and about their personal experiences, when 
doing so will facilitate the therapeutic process (Yontef & Jacobs, 2014; Zahm, 
1998).
connection  between  her  unexpressed  emotions  and  
the  discomfort  in  her  physical  body.  Gestalt  therapy  
gives  Gwen  the  opportunity  to  focus  on  what  is  hap-
pening in her mind and body in the present moment 
and  on  how  an  expression  of  emotions  can  lead  to  a  
release in her physical body. Gestalt therapy can assist 
Gwen  in  becoming  more  aware  of  herself  as  a  whole  
person.  She  can  begin  to  challenge  unfinished  busi-
ness that has enabled her to experience success in her 
career but has also resulted in her feeling overwhelmed 
and filled with anxiety.
Questions for Reflection
What is the importance of exploring bodily sensa-
tions and physical symptoms with Gwen?
What therapeutic value do you see in asking Gwen 
to “become her hip” and speak from it?
What are your reactions to the way that the thera-
pist introduced the idea to Gwen of carrying out 
an experiment?
How might you have experienced doing this exper-
iment if you were in Gwen’s position?

Contributions of Gestalt Therapy
One contribution of Gestalt therapy is the exciting way in which the past is 
dealt with in a lively manner by bringing relevant aspects into the present. Thera-
pists challenge clients in creative ways to become aware of and work with issues that 
are obstructing current functioning. Further, paying attention to the obvious verbal 
and nonverbal leads provided by clients is a useful way to approach a counseling ses-
sion. Through the skillful and sensitive use of Gestalt interventions, practitioners 
can assist clients in heightening their present-centered awareness of what they are 
thinking and feeling as well as what they are doing.
Gestalt methods bring conflicts and human struggles to life. Gestalt therapy is 
a creative approach that uses experiments to move clients from talk to action and 
experience. The creative and spontaneous use of active experiments is a pathway to 
experiential learning. The focus is on growth and enhancement rather than being a 
system of techniques to treat disorders, which reflects an early Gestalt motto, “You 
don’t have to be sick to get better.” Clients are provided with a wide range of tools—
in  the  form  of  Gestalt  experiments—for  discovering  new  facets  of  themselves  and  
making decisions about changing their course of living.
The Gestalt approach to working with dreams is a unique pathway for people to 
increase their awareness of key themes in their lives. By seeing each aspect of a dream 
as a projection of themselves, clients are able to bring the dream to life, to interpret 
its personal meaning, and to assume responsibility for it.
Gestalt therapy is a holistic approach that values each aspect of the individual’s 
experience  equally.  Therapists  allow  the  figure-formation  process  to  guide  them.  
They  do  not  approach  clients  with  a  preconceived  set  of  biases  or  a  set  agenda.  
Instead, they place emphasis on what occurs at the boundary between the individual 
and the environment. Therapists do not try to move the client anywhere. The main 
goal is to increase the client’s awareness of “what is.” Instead of trying to make some-
thing  happen,  the  therapist’s  role  is  assisting  the  client  to  increase  awareness  that  
will allow reidentification with the part of the self from which he or she is alienated.
A  key  strength  of  Gestalt  therapy  is  the  attempt  to  integrate  theory,  practice,  
and  research.  Although  Gestalt  therapy  was  light  on  empirical  research  for  several  
years,  it  has  come  more  into  vogue  recently.  Two  books  show  potential  for  influ-
encing  future  research:  Handbook  for  Theory,  Research  and  Practice  in  Gestalt  Therapy 
(Brownell,  2008);  and  Becoming  a  Practitioner  Researcher:  A  Gestalt  Approach  to  Holistic  
Inquiry (Barber, 2006). Strumpfel and Goldman (2002) note that both process and 
outcome studies have advanced the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy, and they 
summarize a number of significant findings based on outcome research:
Outcome studies have demonstrated Gestalt therapy to be equal to or 
greater than other therapies for various disorders.
More recent studies have shown that Gestalt therapy has a beneficial 
impact with personality disturbances, psychosomatic problems, and 
substance addictions.
The effects of Gestalt therapy tend to be stable in follow-up studies one 
to three years after termination of treatment.
Gestalt therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in treating a variety of 
psychological disorders.

226            CHAPTER EIGHT 
Limitations and Criticisms of Gestalt Therapy
Most  of  my  criticisms  of  Gestalt  therapy  pertain  to  the  traditional  version,  or  the  
style of Fritz Perls, which emphasized confrontation and de-emphasized the cogni-
tive  factors  of  personality.  This  style  of  Gestalt  therapy  placed  more  attention  on  
using techniques to confront clients and getting them to experience their feelings. 
Contemporary  Gestalt  therapy  has  come  a  long  way,  and  more  attention  is  being  
given to theoretical instruction, theoretical exposition, and cognitive factors in gen-
eral (Yontef, 1993, 1995).
In Gestalt therapy clients clarify their thinking, explore beliefs, and put meaning 
to experiences they are reliving in therapy. Clients assume an active role in partici-
pating in experiments, and they learn experientially. The emphasis is on facilitating 
the  clients’  own  process  of  self-discovery  and  learning.  This  experiential  and  self-
directed  learning  process  is  based  on  the  fundamental  belief  in  organismic  self-
regulation, which implies that clients arrive at their own truths through awareness 
and improved contact with the environment. It seems to me, however, that clients 
can engage in self-discovery and at the same time benefit from appropriate teaching 
by the therapist. In addition to the benefits of experiential learning, clients can profit 
from timely and useful information, and a psychoeducational focus can enhance the 
learning process.
Contemporary Gestalt practice places a high value on the contact and dialogue 
between therapist and client. For Gestalt therapy to be effective, the therapist must 
have a high level of personal development. Being aware of one’s own needs and see-
ing that they do not interfere with the client’s process, being present in the moment, 
and being willing to be nondefensive and self-revealing all demand a lot of the thera-
pist. There is a danger that therapists who are inadequately trained will be primarily 
concerned with impressing clients.
Some  Cautions  Typically,  Gestalt  therapists  are  highly  active  and  exhibit  
sensitivity,  timing,  inventiveness,  empathy,  and  respect  for  the  client  (Zinker,  
1978). If therapists lack these qualities, their experiments can easily boomerang. 
Some  therapists  employ  Gestalt  techniques  without  having  a  sound  theoretical  
rationale.  Inept  therapists  may  use  powerful  techniques  to  stir  up  feelings  and  
open  up  problems  clients  have  kept  from  full  awareness  only  to  abandon  the  
clients once they have managed to have a dramatic catharsis. Such a failure to stay 
with clients and help them work through what they have experienced and bring 
some  closure  to  the  experience  can  be  detrimental  and  could  be  considered  as  
unethical practice.
Effective  practitioners  of  Gestalt  therapy  require  a  strong  general  clinical  
background and training, not only in the theory and practice of Gestalt therapy 
but also in personality theory, psychopathology, and knowledge of psychodynam-
ics  (Yontef  &  Jacobs,  2014).  Competent  practitioners  need  to  have  engaged  in  
their own personal therapy and to have had advanced clinical training and super-
vised experience. Such therapists have learned to blend a phenomenological and 
dialogic  approach,  which  is  inherently  respectful  to  the  client,  with  well-timed  
experiments.

Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What are some advantages you can see in asking clients to bring any 
problems or concerns they are experiencing into the here and now?
2. The ability of a therapist to be present during the therapy session is 
central in Gestalt therapy practice. Can you think of some challenges 
you are likely to face in being fully present for your clients? How can 
you deal with these challenges?
3.
 What do you understand as the difference between an experiment and 
an exercise or technique in Gestalt therapy?
4. Energy and blocks to energy are given prominence in Gestalt therapy. 
What are some ideas you have for working with a client’s energy with-
out making interpretations for the client?
5.
 Imagine yourself as a client with a Gestalt therapist. What do you think 
this experience would be like for you?
Where to Go From Here
Visit CengageBrain.com or watch the DVD for Integrative Counseling: The Case of Ruth 
and Lecturettes, Session 7 (Emotive Focus in Counseling), in which I demonstrate how 
I  create  experiments  to  heighten  Ruth’s  awareness.  In  my  version  of  Gestalt  work  
with  Ruth,  I  watch  for  cues  from  Ruth  about  what  she  is  experiencing  in  the  here  
and now. By attending to what she is expressing both verbally and nonverbally, I am 
able to suggest experiments during our sessions. In this particular session I employ a 
Gestalt experiment, asking Ruth to talk to me as if I were her husband, John. During 
this experiment, Ruth becomes quite emotional. You will see ways of exploring emo-
tional material and integrating this work into a cognitive framework as well.

Gestalt  Therapy  Verbatim  (Perls,  1969a)  provides  a  
firsthand  account  of  the  way  Fritz  Perls  worked.  It  
contains  many  verbatim  transcripts  of  workshop  
demonstrations.
Gestalt  Therapy  (Wheeler  &  Axelsson,  2015)  offers  
an  excellent  introduction  to  the  theory,  evolution,  
research,  and  practice  of  Gestalt  therapy.  The  book  
is based on principles that encourage an active, pres-
ent-focused, relational stance on the therapist’s part.
Gestalt Therapy: History, Theory, and Practice (Woldt & 
Toman, 2005) introduces the historical underpinnings 
and  key  concepts  of  Gestalt  therapy  and  features  
applications of those concepts to therapeutic practice. 
This is a significant publication in the field of Gestalt 
therapy  that  contains  pedagogical  learning  activities  
and  experiments,  review  questions,  and  photographs  
of all contributors.
Gestalt  Therapy  Integrated:  Contours  of  Theory  and  
Practice  (E.  Polster  &  Polster,  1973)  is  a  classic  in  
the  field  and  an  excellent  source  for  those  who  
want  a  more  advanced  and  theoretical  treatment  
of this model.

B.   F.   SKINNER   (1904–1990)   reported   
that he was brought up in a warm, stable 
family  environment.*  As  he  was  grow-
ing  up,  Skinner  was  greatly  interested  
in  building  all  sorts  of  things,  an  inter-
est  that  followed  him  throughout  his  
professional  life.  He  received  his  PhD  in  
psychology  from  Harvard  University  in  
1931 and eventually returned to Harvard 
after  teaching  in  several  universities.  He  
had  two  daughters,  one  of  whom  is  an  
educational  psychologist  and  the  other  
an artist.
Skinner   was   a   prominent   spokesperson   for   
behaviorism  and  can  be  considered  the  father  of  the  
behavioral  approach  to  psychology.  Skinner  cham-
pioned  radical  behaviorism,  which  places  primary  
emphasis on the effects of environment on behavior. 
Skinner was also a determinist; he did not believe that 
humans had free choice. He acknowledged that feel-
ings and thoughts exist, but he denied that they caused 
our actions. Instead, he stressed the cause-and-effect 
links  between  objective,  observable  environmental  
conditions  and  behavior.  Skinner  maintained  that  
too much attention had been given to internal states 
of mind and motives, which cannot be observed and 
changed  directly,  and  that  too  little  focus  had  been  
given  to  environmental  factors  that  can  
be   directly   observed   and   changed.   He   
was  extremely  interested  in  the  concept  
of  reinforcement,  which  he  applied  to  
his  own  life.  For  example,  after  working  
for  many  hours,  he  would  go  into  his  
constructed  cocoon  (like  a  tent),  put  on  
headphones, and listen to classical music 
(Frank   Dattilio,   personal   communica-
tion, September 24, 2010).
Most  of  Skinner’s  work  was  of  an  
experimental  nature  in  the  laboratory,  
but others have applied his ideas to teach-
ing,  managing  human  problems,  and  social  plan-
ning. Science and Human Behavior (Skinner, 1953) best 
illustrates how Skinner thought behavioral concepts 
could  be  applied  to  every  domain  of  human  behav-
ior.  In  Walden  II  (1948)  Skinner  describes  a  utopian  
community in which his ideas, derived from the lab-
oratory,  are  applied  to  social  issues.  His  1971  book,  
Beyond  Freedom  and  Dignity,  addressed  the  need  for  
drastic changes if our society was to survive. Skinner 
believed that science and technology held the promise 
for a better future.

ALBERT  BANDURA  (b.  1925)  was  born  
in  a  small  town  in  northern  Alberta,  
Canada; he was the youngest of six chil-
dren  in  a  family  of  Eastern  European  
descent.*   Bandura   spent   his   elemen-
tary  and  high  school  years  in  the  one  
school   in   town,   which   was   short   of   
teachers  and  resources.  These  meager  
educational  resources  proved  to  be  an  
asset  rather  than  a  liability  as  Bandura  
early  on  learned  the  skills  of  self-direct-
edness,  which  would  later  become  one  
of  his  research  themes.  He  earned  his  
PhD  in  clinical  psychology  from  the  University  of  
Iowa  in  1952,  and  a  year  later  he  joined  the  faculty  
at  Stanford  University.  Bandura  and  his  colleagues  
did  pioneering  work  in  the  area  of  social  model-
ing  and  demonstrated  that  modeling  is  a  powerful  
process  that  explains  diverse  forms  of  learning  (see  
Bandura 1971a, 1971b; Bandura & Wal-
ters,  1963).  In  his  research  programs  at  
Stanford  University,  Bandura  and  his  
colleagues  explored  social  learning  the-
ory  and  the  prominent  role  of  observa-
tional  learning  and  social  modeling  in  
human motivation, thought, and action. 
By the mid-1980s Bandura had renamed 
his   theoretical   approach   social   cogni-
tive  theory,  which  shed  light  on  how  we  
function   as   self-organizing,   proactive,   
self-reflective, and self-regulating beings 
(see Bandura, 1986). This notion that we 
are not simply reactive organisms shaped by environ-
mental forces or driven by inner impulses represented 
a dramatic shift in the development of behavior ther-
apy.  Bandura  broadened  the  scope  of  behavior  ther-
apy  by  exploring  the  inner  cognitive-affective  forces  
that motivate human behavior.

Introduction
behavior  therapy  practitioners  focus  on  directly  observable  behavior,  current  
determinants  of  behavior,  learning  experiences  that  promote  change,  tailoring  
treatment  strategies  to  individual  clients,  and  rigorous  assessment  and  evalua-
tion. Behavior therapy has been used to treat a wide range of psychological disor-
ders with specific client populations. Anxiety disorders, depression, posttraumatic 
stress  disorder,  substance  abuse,  eating  and  weight  disorders,  sexual  problems,  
pain management, and hypertension have all been successfully treated using this 
approach (Wilson, 2011). Behavioral procedures are used in the fields of develop-
mental  disabilities,  mental  illness,  education  and  special  education,  community  
psychology, clinical psychology, rehabilitation, business, self-management, sports 
psychology,  health-related  behaviors,  medicine,  and  gerontology  (Miltenberger,  
2012; Wilson, 2011).
Historical Background
The behavioral approach had its origin in the 1950s and early 1960s, and it 
was a radical departure from the dominant psychoanalytic perspective. The behav-
ior therapy movement differed from other therapeutic approaches in its application 
of principles of classical and operant conditioning (which will be explained shortly) 
to the treatment of a variety of problem behaviors. Today, it is difficult to find a con-
sensus  on  the  definition  of  behavior  therapy  because  the  field  has  grown,  become  
more complex, and is marked by a diversity of views. Contemporary behavior ther-
apy is no longer limited to treatments based on traditional learning theory (Antony 
&  Roemer,  2011b),  and  it  increasingly  overlaps  with  other  theoretical  approaches  
(Antony, 2014). Behavior therapists now use a variety of evidence-based techniques 
in  their  practices,  including  cognitive  therapy,  social  skills  training,  relaxation  
LO1
There  are  some  existential  qualities  inherent  in  
Bandura’s  social  cognitive  theory.  Bandura  has  pro-
duced  a  wealth  of  empirical  evidence  that  demon-
strates  the  life  choices  we  have  in  all  aspects  of  our  
lives.  In  Self-Efficacy:  The  Exercise  of  Control  (Bandura,  
1997),  Bandura  shows  the  comprehensive  applica-
tions  of  his  theory  of  self-efficacy  to  areas  such  as  
human  development,  psychology,  psychiatry,  educa-
tion,  medicine  and  health,  athletics,  business,  social  
and political change, and international affairs.
Bandura  has  concentrated  on  four  areas  of  
research:  (1)  the  power  of  psychological  modeling  
in  shaping  thought,  emotion,  and  action;  (2)  the  
mechanisms  of  human  agency,  or  the  ways  peo-
ple  influence  their  own  motivation  and  behavior  
through  choice;  (3)  people’s  perceptions  of  their  
efficacy  to  exercise  influence  over  the  events  that  
affect  their  lives;  and  (4)  how  stress  reactions  and  
depressions are caused. Bandura has created one of 
the  few  mega-theories  that  still  thrive  in  the  21st  
century.  He  has  shown  that  people  need  a  sense  of  
self-efficacy and resilience to create a successful life 
and to meet the inevitable obstacles and adversities 
they encounter.
Bandura has written nine books, many of which 
have been translated into various languages. In 2004 
he  received  the  Outstanding  Lifetime  Contribution  
to Psychology Award from the American Psychologi-
cal Association. He still makes time for hiking, opera, 
being  with  his  family,  and  wine  tasting  in  the  Napa  
and Sonoma valleys.
*This biography is based largely on Panjares’s (2004) discussion of 
Bandura’s life and work.

training,  and  mindfulness  strategies—all  discussed  in  this  chapter.  The  following  
historical sketch of behavior therapy is largely based on Spiegler (2016).
Traditional behavior therapy arose simultaneously in the United States, South 
Africa, and Great Britain in the 1950s. In spite of harsh criticism and resistance from 
psychoanalytic psychotherapists, the approach has survived. Its focus was on dem-
onstrating that behavioral conditioning techniques were effective and were a viable 
alternative to psychoanalytic therapy.
In the 1960s Albert Bandura developed social learning theory, which combined 
classical  and  operant  conditioning  with  observational  learning.  Bandura  made  
cognition  a  legitimate  focus  for  behavior  therapy.  During  the  1960s  a  number  of  
cognitive behavioral approaches sprang up, which focus on cognitive representations of 
the environment rather than on characteristics of the objective environment.
Contemporary behavior therapy emerged as a major force in psychology during 
the 1970s, and it had a significant impact on education, psychology, psychotherapy, 
psychiatry, and social work. Behavioral techniques were expanded to provide solu-
tions  for  business,  industry,  and  child-rearing  problems  as  well.  Behavior  therapy  
techniques were viewed as the treatment of choice for many psychological problems.
The 1980s were characterized by a search for new horizons in concepts and methods 
that went beyond traditional learning theory. Behavior therapists continued to subject 
their methods to empirical scrutiny and to consider the impact of the practice of therapy 
on both their clients and the larger society. Increased attention was given to the role of 
emotions in therapeutic change, as well as to the role of biological factors in psychologi-
cal disorders. Two of the most significant developments in the field were (1) the contin-
ued emergence of cognitive behavior therapy as a major force and (2) the application of 
behavioral techniques to the prevention and treatment of health-related disorders.
By the late 1990s the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) 
(formerly known as the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy) claimed 
a membership of about 4,500. Currently, ABCT includes approximately 6,000 men-
tal health professionals and students who are interested in empirically based behav-
ior therapy or cognitive behavior therapy. This name change and description reveals 
the current thinking of integrating behavioral and cognitive therapies.
By the early 2000s, the behavioral tradition had broadened considerably, which 
involved  enlarging  the  scope  of  research  and  practice.  This  newest  development,  
sometimes  known  as  the  “third  generation”  or  “third  wave”  of  behavior  therapy,  
includes  dialectical  behavior  therapy  (DBT),  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  
(MBSR),  mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy  (MBCT),  and  acceptance  and  com-
mitment therapy (ACT). Behavior therapies are among the most widely used treat-
ment interventions for psychological and behavioral problems today (Antony, 2014).

Four Areas of Development
Contemporary  behavior  therapy  can  be  understood  by  considering  four  
major  areas  of  development:  (1)  classical  conditioning,  (2)  operant  conditioning,  
(3) social-cognitive theory, and (4) cognitive behavior therapy.

classical conditioning (respondent conditioning) refers to what happens prior 
to learning that creates a response through pairing. A key figure in this area is Ivan 
Pavlov who illustrated classical conditioning through experiments with dogs. Plac-
ing food in a dog’s mouth leads to salivation, which is respondent behavior. When 
food is repeatedly presented with some originally neutral stimulus (something that 
does not elicit a particular response), such as the sound of a bell, the dog will eventu-
ally salivate to the sound of the bell alone. However, if a bell is sounded repeatedly 
but not paired again with food, the salivation response will eventually diminish and 
become extinct. An example of a procedure that is based on the classical condition-
ing model is Joseph Wolpe’s systematic desensitization, which is described later in 
this chapter. This technique illustrates how principles of learning derived from the 
experimental laboratory can be applied clinically. Desensitization can be applied to 
people who, through classical conditioning, developed an intense fear of flying after 
having a frightening experience while flying.
Technically one can develop an intense fear of flying without having a frighten-
ing  experience  personally.  For  example,  someone  may  see  visual  images  of  a  plane  
crashing off the coast of Brazil and develop a fear of flying even though that person 
has never flown anywhere. Some researchers hold a different view and believe that 
fear of flying may be due primarily to claustrophobia (Frank Dattilio, personal com-
munication, September 24, 2010).
Most of the significant responses we make in everyday life are examples of oper-
ant behaviors, such as reading, writing, driving a car, and eating with utensils. Oper-
ant  conditioning  involves  a  type  of  learning  in  which  behaviors  are  influenced  
mainly by the consequences that follow them. If the environmental changes brought 
about  by  the  behavior  are  reinforcing—that  is,  if  they  provide  some  reward  to  the  
organism or eliminate aversive stimuli—the chances are increased that the behavior 
will  occur  again.  If  the  environmental  changes  produce  no  reinforcement  or  pro-
duce  aversive  stimuli,  the  chances  are  lessened  that  the  behavior  will  recur.  Posi-
tive and negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction techniques, described 
later in this chapter, illustrate how operant conditioning in applied settings can be 
instrumental  in  developing  prosocial  and  adaptive  behaviors.  Operant  techniques  
are used by behavioral practitioners in parent education programs and with weight 
management programs.
The   behaviorists   of   both   the   classical   and   operant   conditioning   models   
excluded  any  reference  to  mediational  concepts,  such  as  the  role  of  thinking  pro-
cesses,  attitudes,  and  values.  This  focus  is  perhaps  due  to  a  reaction  against  the  
insight-oriented psychodynamic approaches. The social learning approach (or the 
social-cognitive approach) developed by Albert Bandura and Richard Walters (1963) is 
interactional, interdisciplinary, and multimodal (Bandura, 1977, 1982). Social-cognitive 
theory involves a triadic reciprocal interaction among the environment, personal fac-
tors  (beliefs,  preferences,  expectations,  self-perceptions,  and  interpretations),  and  
individual behavior. In the social-cognitive approach, the environmental events on 
behavior are mainly determined by cognitive processes governing how environmen-
tal influences are perceived by an individual and how these events are interpreted. A 
basic assumption is that people are capable of self-directed behavior change and that 
the person is the agent of change. For Bandura (1982, 1997), self-efficacy is the indi-

of  both  assessment  and  treatment  procedures.  Therapeutic  techniques  employed  
must  have  demonstrated  effectiveness.  In  short,  behavioral  concepts  and  proce-
dures  are  stated  explicitly,  tested  empirically  within  a  conceptual  framework,  and  
revised continually.
Behavior is not limited to overt actions a person engages in that we can observe, 
however;  behavior  also  includes  internal  processes  such  as  cognitions,  images,  
beliefs,  and  emotions.  The  key  characteristic  of  a  behavior  is  that  it  is  something  
that can be operationally defined.
Behavior therapy deals with the client’s current problems and the factors influ-
encing them today rather than analyzing possible historical determinants. Empha-
sis is on specific factors that influence present functioning and what factors can be 
used to modify performance. Behavior therapists look to the current environmental 
events that maintain problem behaviors and help clients produce behavior change 
by changing environmental events, through a process called functional assessment, or 
what  Wolpe  (1990)  referred  to  as  a  “behavioral  analysis.”  Behavior  therapy  recog-
nizes the importance of the individual, the individual’s environment, and the inter-
action between the person and the environment in facilitating change.
Clients  involved  in  behavior  therapy  are  expected  to  assume  an  active  role  by  
engaging in specific actions to deal with their problems. Rather than simply talking 
about their condition, clients are required to do something to bring about change. 
Clients monitor their behaviors both during and outside the therapy sessions, learn 
and practice coping skills, and role-play new behavior. Therapeutic tasks that clients 
carry out in daily life, or homework assignments, are a basic part of this approach. 
Behavior therapy is an action-oriented and an educational approach, and learning is 
viewed as being at the core of therapy. Clients learn new and adaptive behaviors to 
replace old and maladaptive behaviors.
This approach assumes that change can take place without insight into under-
lying dynamics and without understanding the origins of a psychological problem. 
Behavior therapists operate on the premise that changes in behavior can occur prior 
to  or  simultaneously  with  understanding  of  oneself,  and  that  behavioral  changes  
may  well  lead  to  an  increased  level  of  self-understanding.  Although  it  is  true  that  
insight and understanding about the contingencies that exacerbate one’s problems 
can supply motivation to change, knowing that one has a problem and knowing how 
to change it are two different things (Martell, 2007).
Assessment  is  an  ongoing  process  of  observation  and  self-monitoring  that  
focuses  on  the  current  determinants  of  behavior,  including  identifying  the  prob-
lem  and  evaluating  the  change.  Assessment  informs  the  treatment  process  and  
involves  attending  to  the  culture  of  clients  as  part  of  their  social  environments,  
including  social  support  networks  relating  to  target  behaviors.  Critical  to  behav-
ioral approaches is the careful assessment and evaluation of the interventions used 
to determine whether the behavior change resulted from the procedure.
Behavioral  treatment  interventions  are  individually  tailored  to  specific  prob-
lems experienced by the client. Several therapy techniques may be used to treat an 
individual client’s problems. An important question that serves as a guide for this 
choice is, “What treatment, by whom, is the most effective for this individual with that 
specific problem and under which set of circumstances?” (Paul, 1967, p. 111).

The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
Goals occupy a place of central importance in behavior therapy. The general goals 
of behavior therapy are to increase personal choice and to create new conditions for 
learning. The client, with the help of the therapist, defines specific treatment goals 
at the outset of the therapeutic process. Although assessment and treatment occur 
together, a formal assessment takes place prior to treatment to determine behaviors 
that  are  targets  of  change.  Continual  assessment  throughout  therapy  determines  
the degree to which identified goals are being met. It is important to devise a way to 
measure progress toward goals based on empirical validation.
Contemporary behavior therapy stresses clients’ active role in formulating spe-
cific measurable goals. Goals must be clear, concrete, understood, and agreed on by 
the client and the counselor. The counselor and client discuss the behaviors associ-
ated with the goals, the circumstances required for change, the nature of subgoals, 
and a plan of action to work toward these goals. This process of determining thera-
peutic goals entails a negotiation between client and counselor that results in a con-
tract  that  guides  the  course  of  therapy.  Behavior  therapists  and  clients  alter  goals  
throughout the therapeutic process as needed.
Therapist’s Function and Role
Behavior therapists conduct a thorough functional assessment (or behav-
ioral  analysis)  to  identify  the  maintaining  conditions  by  systematically  gather-
ing information about situational antecedents (A), the dimensions of the problem 
behavior (B), and the consequences (C) of the problem. This is known as the 
abc 
model,  and  the  goal  of  a  functional  assessment  of  a  client’s  behavior  is  to  under-
stand the ABC sequence. This model of behavior suggests that behavior (B) is influ-
enced by some particular events that precede it, called antecedents (A), and by certain 
events that follow it, called consequences (C). 
antecedent events cue or elicit a cer-
tain behavior. For example, with a client who has trouble going to sleep, listening to 
a relaxation tape may serve as a cue for sleep induction. Turning off the lights 
and  removing  the  television  from  the  bedroom  may  elicit  sleep  behaviors  as  well.  
consequences are events that maintain a behavior in some way, either by increas-
ing or decreasing it. For example, a client may be more likely to return to counseling 
after the counselor offers verbal praise or encouragement for having come in or for 
having completed some homework. A client may be less likely to return if the coun-
selor is consistently late to sessions. In doing a behavioral assessment interview, 
the therapist’s task is to identify the particular antecedent and consequent events 
that  influence,  or  are  functionally  related  to,  an  individual’s  behavior  (Cormier,  
Nurius, & Osborn, 2013).
Behaviorally oriented practitioners tend to be active and directive and to func-
tion  as  consultants  and  problem  solvers.  They  rely  heavily  on  empirical  evidence  
about  the  efficacy  of  the  techniques  they  apply  to  particular  problems.  Behavioral  
practitioners must have skills in selecting and applying treatment methods. They pay 
close attention to the clues given by clients, and they are willing to follow their clini-
cal hunches. Behavior therapists use some techniques common to other approaches,

such as summarizing, reflection, clarification, and open-ended questioning. Behav-
ior therapists are directive and often offer suggestions (Antony, 2014), but they may 
perform these other functions as well (Miltenberger, 2012; Speigler, 2016):
The therapist strives to understand the function of client behaviors, 
including how certain behaviors originated and how they are sustained. 
With this understanding, the therapist formulates initial treatment 
goals and designs and implements a treatment plan to accomplish 
these goals.
The behavioral clinician uses strategies that have research support for 
use with a particular kind of problem. These evidence-based strategies 
promote generalization and maintenance of behavior change. A num-
ber of these strategies are described later in this chapter.
The clinician evaluates the success of the change plan by measuring 
progress toward the goals throughout the duration of treatment. Out-
come measures are given to the client at the beginning of treatment 
(called a baseline) and collected again periodically during and after 
treatment to determine whether the strategy and treatment plan are 
working. If not, adjustments are made in the strategies being used.
Follow-up assessments are conducted to evaluate whether the changes 
are durable over time. Clients learn how to identify and cope with 
potential setbacks and acquire behavioral and cognitive coping skills to 
maintain changes and to prevent relapses.
Let’s  examine  how  a  behavior  therapist  might  perform  these  functions.  A  cli-
ent comes to therapy to reduce her anxiety, which is preventing her from leaving the 
house.  The  therapist  is  likely  to  begin  with  a  specific  analysis  of  the  nature  of  her  
anxiety.  The  therapist  will  ask  how  she  experiences  the  anxiety  of  leaving  her  house,  
including what she actually does in these situations. Systematically, the therapist gath-
ers information about this anxiety. When did the problem begin? In what situations 
does it arise? What does she do at these times? What are her feelings and thoughts in 
these situations? Who is present when she experiences anxiety? What does she do to 
reduce the anxiety? How do her present fears interfere with living effectively? After this 
assessment, specific behavioral goals are developed, and strategies such as relaxation 
training,  systematic  desensitization,  and  exposure  therapy  are  designed  to  help  the  
client reduce her anxiety to a manageable level. The therapist will get a commitment 
from the client to work toward the specified goals, and the two of them will evaluate 
the client’s progress toward meeting these goals throughout the duration of therapy.
For a description of applying a behavioral approach to the assessment and treat-
ment of an individual client, see Dr. Sherry Cormier’s behavioral interventions with 
Ruth in Case Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 7).
Client’s Experience in Therapy
One of the unique contributions of behavior therapy is that it provides the therapist 
with a well-defined system of procedures to employ. Both therapist and client have 
clearly  defined  roles,  and  the  importance  of  client  awareness  and  participation  in  
the  therapeutic  process  is  stressed.  Behavior  therapy  is  characterized  by  an  active

role  for  both  therapist  and  client.  A  large  part  of  the  therapist’s  role  is  to  teach  
concrete  skills  through  the  provision  of  instructions,  modeling,  and  performance  
feedback.  The  client  engages  in  behavioral  rehearsal  with  feedback  until  skills  are  
well  learned  and  generally  receives  active  homework  assignments  (such  as  self-
monitoring of problem behaviors) to complete between therapy sessions. Behavior 
clinicians emphasize that changes clients make in therapy need to be translated into 
their daily lives.
It is important for clients to be motivated to change, and they are expected to 
cooperate in carrying out therapeutic activities, both during therapy sessions and in 
everyday life. If clients are not involved in this way, the chances are slim that therapy 
will be successful. Motivational interviewing (see Chapter 7), which honors the cli-
ent’s resistance in such a way that his or her motivation to change is increased over 
time, is a behavioral strategy that has considerable empirical support (Miller & Roll-
nick, 2013).
Clients are encouraged to experiment for the purpose of enlarging their reper-
toire of adaptive behaviors. Counseling is not complete unless actions follow verbal-
izations.  Behavioral  practitioners  make  the  assumption  that  it  is  only  when  the  
transfer  of  changes  is  made  from  the  sessions  to  everyday  life  that  the  effects  of  
therapy can be considered successful. Clients are as aware as the therapist is regard-
ing when the goals have been accomplished and when it is appropriate to terminate 
treatment. It is clear that clients are expected to do more than merely gather insights; 
they need to be willing to make changes and to continue implementing new behav-
ior once formal treatment has ended.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Behavioral  practitioners  have  increasingly  recognized  the  role  of  the  thera-
peutic relationship and therapist behavior as critical factors related to the process 
and outcome of treatment. As you will recall, the experiential therapies (existential 
therapy, person-centered therapy, and Gestalt therapy) place primary emphasis on 
the nature of the engagement between counselor and client. Today most behavioral 
practitioners  stress  the  value  of  establishing  a  collaborative  working  relationship  
with clients but contend that warmth, empathy, authenticity, permissiveness, and 
acceptance are necessary, but not sufficient, for behavior change to occur. The client–
therapist  relationship  is  a  foundation  on  which  behavioral  strategies  are  built  to  
help clients change in the direction they wish.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
A strength of the behavioral approaches is the development of specific thera-
peutic procedures that must be shown to be effective through objective means. The 
results of behavioral interventions become clear because therapists receive continual 
direct feedback from their clients. A hallmark of the behavioral approaches is that 
the therapeutic techniques are empirically supported and evidence-based practice is 
highly valued. Behavior therapy has been shown to be effective with many different 
populations and for a wide array of disorders. Behavioral techniques can easily be 
incorporated in other approaches as well.

The therapeutic procedures used by behavior therapists are specifically designed 
for a particular client rather than being randomly selected from a “bag of techniques.” 
Therapists are often quite creative in their interventions. In the following sections I 
describe a range of behavioral techniques available to the practitioner: applied behav-
ioral analysis, relaxation training, systematic desensitization, exposure therapies, eye 
movement desensitization and reprocessing, social skills training, self-management 
programs, multimodal therapy, and mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches. 
These techniques do not encompass the full spectrum of behavioral procedures, but 
they do represent a sample of the approaches used in the practice of contemporary 
behavior therapy.
Applied Behavioral Analysis: Operant Conditioning Techniques
This  section  describes  a  few  key  principles  of  operant  conditioning:  positive  rein-
forcement,  negative  reinforcement,  extinction,  positive  punishment,  and  negative  
punishment.  For  a  detailed  treatment  of  the  wide  range  of  operant  conditioning  
methods that are part of contemporary behavior modification, I recommend Milt-
enberger (2012) and Speigler (2016).
The most important contribution of applied behavior analysis is that it offers a 
functional approach to understanding clients’ problems and addresses these prob-
lems  by  changing  antecedents  and  consequences  (the  ABC  model).  Behaviorists  
believe we respond in predictable ways because of the gains we experience (positive 
reinforcement) or because of the need to escape or avoid unpleasant consequences 
(negative reinforcement). Once clients’ goals have been assessed, specific behaviors 
are targeted. The goal of reinforcement, whether positive or negative, is to increase 
the  target  behavior.  Positive  reinforcement  involves  the  addition  of  something  of  
value to the individual (such as praise, attention, money, or food) as a consequence 
of certain behavior. The stimulus that follows the behavior is the positive reinforcer. 
For example, a child earns excellent grades and is praised for studying by her parents. 
If she values this praise, it is likely that she will have an investment in studying in the 
future. When the goal of a program is to decrease or eliminate undesirable behav-
iors, positive reinforcement is often used to increase the frequency of more desirable 
behaviors, which replace undesirable behaviors. In the above example, the parental 
praise  functions  as  the  positive  reinforcer  and  makes  it  more  likely  that  the  child  
will maintain or even increase the frequency of studying and earning good grades. 
Note that if a child did not value parental praise, this would not serve as a reinforcer. 
The reinforcer is not defined by the form or substance that it takes but rather by the 
function it serves: namely, to maintain or increase the frequency of a desired behavior.
negative  reinforcement  involves  the  escape  from  or  the  avoidance  of  aversive  
(unpleasant)  stimuli.  The  individual  is  motivated  to  exhibit  a  desired  behavior  to  
avoid the unpleasant condition. For example, a friend of mine does not appreciate 
waking up to the shrill sound of an alarm clock. She has trained herself to wake up 
a few minutes before the alarm sounds to avoid the aversive stimulus of the alarm 
buzzer.
Another  operant  method  of  changing  behavior  is  extinction,  which  refers  to  
withholding  reinforcement  from  a  previously  reinforced  response.  In  applied  set-
tings,  extinction  can  be  used  for  behaviors  that  have  been  maintained  by  positive

reinforcement or negative reinforcement. For example, in the case of children who 
display temper tantrums, parents often reinforce this behavior by the attention they 
give to it. An approach to dealing with problematic behavior is to eliminate the con-
nection  between  a  certain  behavior  (tantrums)  and  positive  reinforcement  (atten-
tion).  In  this  example,  if  the  parent  ignores  the  child’s  tantrum-related  behaviors,  
these behaviors will decrease or be eliminated through the extinction process. It should 
be  noted  that  extinction  might  well  have  negative  side  effects,  such  as  anger  and  
aggression.  Also  note  that  during  the  extinction  process  unwanted  behaviors  may  
increase temporarily before they begin to decrease. Extinction can reduce or elimi-
nate  certain  behaviors,  but  extinction  does  not  replace  those  responses  that  have  
been extinguished.
Another way behavior is controlled is through punishment, sometimes referred 
to  as  aversive  control,  in  which  the  consequences  of  a  certain  behavior  result  in  a  
decrease of that behavior. The goal of reinforcement is to increase target behavior, but 
the  goal  of  punishment  is  to  decrease  target  behavior.  Miltenberger  (2012)  describes  
two  kinds  of  punishment  that  may  occur  as  a  consequence  of  behavior:  positive  
punishment and negative punishment. In positive punishment an aversive stimu-
lus is added after the behavior to decrease the frequency of a behavior (such as a time-
out procedure with a child who is displaying misbehavior).
In negative punishment a reinforcing stimulus is removed following the behav-
ior to decrease the frequency of a target behavior (such as deducting money from a 
worker’s salary for missing time at work, or taking television time away from a child 
for misbehavior). In both kinds of punishment, the behavior is less likely to occur in 
the future. These four operant procedures form the basis of behavior therapy pro-
grams  for  parent  skills  training  and  are  also  used  in  the  self-management  proce-
dures that are discussed later in this chapter.
Some behavioral practitioners are opposed to using aversive control or punish-
ment  and  recommended  substituting  positive  reinforcement.  The  key  principle  in  
the  applied  behavior  analysis  approach  is  to  use  the  least  aversive  means  possible  
to  change  behavior,  and  positive  reinforcement  is  known  to  be  the  most  powerful  
change agent. It is essential that reinforcement be used as a way to develop appropri-
ate behaviors that replace the behaviors that are suppressed.
Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Progressive  muscle  relaxation  has  become  increasingly  popular  as  a  method  of  
teaching  people  to  cope  with  the  stresses  produced  by  daily  living.  It  is  aimed  at  
achieving muscle and mental relaxation and is easily learned. After clients learn the 
basics of relaxation procedures, it is essential that they practice these exercises daily 
to obtain maximum results.
Jacobson (1938) is credited with initially developing the progressive muscle relax-
ation  procedure.  It  has  since  been  refined  and  modified,  and  relaxation  procedures  
are  frequently  used  in  combination  with  a  number  of  other  behavioral  techniques.  
Progressive muscle relaxation involves several components. Clients are given a set of 
instructions that teaches them to relax. They assume a passive and relaxed position 
in a quiet environment while alternately contracting and relaxing muscles. This pro-
gressive muscle relaxation is explicitly taught to the client by the therapist. Deep and

regular breathing also is associated with producing relaxation. At the same time cli-
ents learn to mentally “let go,” perhaps by focusing on pleasant thoughts or images. 
Clients are instructed to actually feel and experience the tension building up, to notice 
their muscles getting tighter and study this tension, and to hold and fully experience 
the tension. It is useful for clients to experience the difference between a tense and a 
relaxed state. The client is then taught how to relax all the muscles while visualizing 
the various parts of the body, with emphasis on the facial muscles. The arm muscles 
are  relaxed  first,  followed  by  the  head,  the  neck  and  shoulders,  the  back,  abdomen,  
and  thorax,  and  then  the  lower  limbs.  Relaxation  becomes  a  well-learned  response,  
which can become a habitual pattern if practiced daily for about 25 minutes each day.
Relaxation procedures have been applied to a variety of clinical problems, either 
as a separate technique or in conjunction with related methods. The most common 
use  has  been  with  problems  related  to  stress  and  anxiety,  which  are  often  mani-
fested  in  psychosomatic  symptoms.  Relaxation  training  has  benefits  in  areas  such  
as  preparing  patients  for  surgery,  teaching  clients  how  to  cope  with  chronic  pain,  
and reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (Ferguson & Sgambati, 2008). Some 
other  ailments  for  which  progressive  muscle  relaxation  is  helpful  include  asthma,  
headache,  hypertension,  insomnia,  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  and  panic  disorder  
(Cormier et al., 2013).
For an exercise of the phases of the progressive muscle relaxation procedure that 
you can apply to yourself, see Student Manual for Theory and Practice of Counseling and 
Psychotherapy  (Corey,  2017).  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  progressive  muscle  
relaxation, see Ferguson and Sgambati (2008).
Systematic Desensitization
systematic desensitization, which is based on the principle of classical condition-
ing, is a basic behavioral procedure developed by Joseph Wolpe, one of the pioneers 
of behavior therapy. Clients imagine successively more anxiety-arousing situations 
at the same time that they engage in a behavior that competes with anxiety. Grad-
ually,  or  systematically,  clients  become  less  sensitive  (desensitized)  to  the  anxiety-
arousing  situation.  This  procedure  can  be  considered  a  form  of  exposure  therapy  
because  clients  are  required  to  expose  themselves  to  anxiety-arousing  images  as  a  
way to reduce anxiety.
Systematic  desensitization  is  an  empirically  researched  behavior  therapy  pro-
cedure  that  is  time  consuming,  yet  it  is  clearly  effective  and  efficient  in  reducing  
maladaptive  anxiety  and  treating  anxiety-related  disorders,  particularly  in  the  area  
of specific phobias (Cormier et al., 2013; Spiegler, 2016). Before implementing the 
desensitization procedure, the therapist conducts an initial interview to identify spe-
cific information about the anxiety and to gather relevant background information 
about the client. This interview, which may last several sessions, gives the therapist 
a good understanding of who the client is. The therapist questions the client about 
the  particular  circumstances  that  elicit  the  conditioned  fears.  For  instance,  under  
what  circumstances  does  the  client  feel  anxious?  If  the  client  is  anxious  in  social  
situations,  does  the  anxiety  vary  with  the  number  of  people  present?  Is  the  client  
more  anxious  with  women  or  men?  The  client  is  asked  to  begin  a  self-monitoring  
process consisting of observing and recording situations during the week that elicit

anxiety responses. Some therapists also administer a questionnaire to gather addi-
tional data about situations leading to anxiety.
If the decision is made to use the desensitization procedure, the therapist gives 
the client a rationale for the procedure and briefly describes what is involved. A three-
step process is carried out in the desensitization process: (1) relaxation training, (2) 
development  of  a  graduated  anxiety  hierarchy,  and  (3)  systematic  desensitization  
through presentation of hierarchy items while the client is in a deeply relaxed state 
(Head & Gross, 2008).
The  first  step  is  progressive  muscle  relaxation,  which  were  described  earlier.  The  
therapist uses a quiet, soft, and pleasant voice to teach progressive muscular relax-
ation.  The  client  is  asked  to  create  imagery  of  previously  relaxing  situations,  such  
as sitting by a lake or wandering through a beautiful field. It is important that the 
client  reach  a  state  of  calm  and  peacefulness.  The  client  is  instructed  to  practice  
relaxation both as a part of the desensitization procedure and also outside the ses-
sion on a daily basis.
The therapist then works with the client to develop an anxiety hierarchy for each 
of  the  identified  areas.  Stimuli  that  elicit  anxiety  in  a  particular  area  are  analyzed,  
such as rejection, jealousy, criticism, disapproval, or any phobia. The therapist con-
structs a ranked list of situations that elicit increasing degrees of anxiety or avoid-
ance. The hierarchy is arranged in order from the most anxiety-provoking situation 
the client can imagine down to the situation that evokes the least anxiety. If it has 
been  determined  that  the  client  has  anxiety  related  to  fear  of  rejection,  for  exam-
ple, the highest anxiety-producing situation might be rejection by the spouse, next, 
rejection  by  a  close  friend,  and  then  rejection  by  a  coworker.  The  least  disturbing  
situation might be a stranger’s indifference toward the client at a party.
Desensitization does not begin until several sessions after the initial interview has 
been  completed.  Enough  time  is  allowed  for  clients  to  learn  relaxation  in  therapy  
sessions, to practice it at home, and to construct their anxiety hierarchy. The desen-
sitization  process  begins  with  the  client  reaching  complete  relaxation  with  eyes  
closed. A neutral scene is presented, and the client is asked to imagine it. If the client 
remains  relaxed,  he  or  she  is  asked  to  imagine  the  least  anxiety-arousing  scene  on  
the  hierarchy  of  situations  that  has  been  developed.  The  therapist  moves  progres-
sively up the hierarchy until the client signals that he or she is experiencing anxiety, 
at  which  time  the  scene  is  terminated.  Relaxation  is  then  induced  again,  and  the  
scene is reintroduced again until little anxiety is experienced to it. Treatment ends 
when the client is able to remain in a relaxed state while imagining the scene that 
was  formerly  the  most  disturbing  and  anxiety-producing.  The  core  of  systematic  
desensitization  is  repeated  exposure  in  the  imagination  to  anxiety-evoking  situa-
tions without experiencing any negative consequences.
Homework  and  follow-up  are  essential  components  of  successful  desensiti-
zation.  Clients  are  encouraged  to  practice  selected  relaxation  procedures  daily,  at  
which time they visualize scenes completed in the previous session. Gradually, they 
can expose themselves to daily-life situations as a further way to manage their anxi-
eties. Clients tend to benefit the most when they have a variety of ways to cope with 
anxiety-arousing  situations  that  they  can  continue  to  use  once  therapy  has  ended  
(Head & Gross, 2008).

Systematic  desensitization  is  among  the  most  empirically  supported  therapy  
methods available, especially for the treatment of anxiety. Not only does systematic 
desensitization have a good track record in dealing with fears, it also has been used 
to treat a variety of conditions including anger, asthmatic attacks, insomnia, motion 
sickness, nightmares, and sleepwalking (Spiegler, 2016). Systematic desensitization 
is often acceptable to clients because they are gradually and symbolically exposed to 
anxiety-evoking situations. For a more detailed discussion of systematic desensitiza-
tion, see Head and Gross (2008), Speigler (2016), and Cormier et al. (2013).
In Vivo Exposure and Flooding
exposure therapies are designed to treat fears and other negative emotional responses 
by introducing clients, under carefully controlled conditions, to the situations that 
contributed  to  such  problems.  Exposure  is  a  key  process  in  treating  a  wide  range  
of problems associated with fear and anxiety. Exposure therapy involves systematic 
confrontation  with  a  feared  stimulus,  either  through  imagination  or  in  vivo  (live).  
Imaginal  exposure  can  be  used  prior  to  implementing  in  vivo  exposure  when  a  
client’s  fears  are  so  severe  that  the  client  is  unable  to  participate  in  live  exposure  
(Hazlett-Stevens  &  Craske,  2008).  Whatever  route  is  used,  exposure  involves  con-
tact by clients with what they find fearful. Desensitization is one type of exposure 
therapy, but there are others. Two variations of traditional systematic desensitiza-
tion are in vivo exposure and flooding.
In Vivo Exposure In vivo exposure involves client exposure to the actual anxiety-
evoking events rather than simply imagining these situations. Live exposure has been 
a  cornerstone  of  behavior  therapy  for  decades.  Hazlett-Stevens  and  Craske  (2008)  
describe  the  key  elements  of  the  process  of  in  vivo  exposure.  Typically,  treatment  
begins  with  a  functional  analysis  of  objects  or  situations  a  person  avoids  or  fears.  
Together, the therapist and the client generate a hierarchy of situations for the client 
to  encounter  in  ascending  order  of  difficulty.  In  vivo  exposure  involves  repeated  
systematic  exposure  to  fear  items,  beginning  from  the  bottom  of  the  hierarchy.  
Clients engage in a brief, graduated series of exposures to feared events. As is the case 
with systematic desensitization, clients learn responses incompatible with anxiety, 
such as responses involving muscle relaxation. Clients are encouraged eventually to 
experience their full fear response during exposure without engaging in avoidance. 
Between therapy sessions, clients carry out self-directed exposure exercises. Clients’ 
progress  with  home  practice  is  reviewed,  and  the  therapist  provides  feedback  on  
how the client could deal with any difficulties encountered.
In some cases the therapist may accompany clients as they encounter feared sit-
uations. For example, a therapist could go with clients in an elevator if they had pho-
bias of using elevators. Of course, when this kind of out-of-office procedure is used, 
matters of safety and appropriate ethical boundaries are always considered. People 
who have extreme fears of certain animals could be exposed to these animals in real 
life in a safe setting with a therapist. Self-managed in vivo exposure—a procedure in 
which clients expose themselves to anxiety-evoking events on their own—is an alter-
native when it is not practical for a therapist to be with clients in real-life situations.

Flooding Another form of exposure therapy is flooding, which refers to either in 
vivo or imaginal exposure to anxiety-evoking stimuli for a prolonged period of time. 
As  is  characteristic  of  all  exposure  therapies,  even  though  the  client  experiences  
anxiety during the exposure, the feared consequences do not occur.
in vivo flooding consists of intense and prolonged exposure to the actual anx-
iety-producing stimuli. Remaining exposed to feared stimuli for a prolonged period 
without engaging in any anxiety-reducing behaviors allows the anxiety to decrease 
on its own. Generally, highly fearful clients tend to curb their anxiety through the 
use  of  maladaptive  behaviors.  In  flooding,  clients  are  prevented  from  engaging  in  
their  usual  maladaptive  responses  to  anxiety-arousing  situations.  In  vivo  flooding  
tends to reduce anxiety rapidly.
Imaginal flooding is based on similar principles and follows the same proce-
dures except the exposure occurs in the client’s imagination instead of in daily life. 
An advantage of using imaginal flooding over in vivo flooding is that there are no 
restrictions on the nature of the anxiety-arousing situations that can be treated. In 
vivo exposure to actual traumatic events (airplane crash, rape, fire, flood) is often 
not  possible  nor  is  it  appropriate  for  both  ethical  and  practical  reasons.  Imagi-
nal flooding can re-create the circumstances of the trauma in a way that does not 
bring  about  adverse  consequences  to  the  client.  Survivors  of  an  airplane  crash,  
for example, may suffer from a range of debilitating symptoms. They are likely to 
have nightmares and flashbacks to the disaster; they may avoid travel by air or have 
anxiety about travel by any means; and they probably have a variety of distressing 
symptoms such as guilt, anxiety, and depression. In vivo and imaginal exposure, 
as  well  as  flooding,  are  frequently  used  in  the  behavioral  treatment  for  anxiety-
related disorders, specific phobia, social phobia, panic disorder, obsessive-compul-
sive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and agoraphobia (Hazlett-Stevens & 
Craske, 2008).
Because  of  the  discomfort  associated  with  prolonged  and  intense  exposure,  
some  clients  may  not  elect  these  exposure  treatments.  It  is  important  for  the  
behavior therapist to work with the client to create motivation and readiness for 
exposure. From an ethical perspective, clients should have adequate information 
about  prolonged  and  intense  exposure  therapy  before  agreeing  to  participate.  It  
is important that they understand that anxiety will be induced as a way to reduce 
it.  Clients  need  to  make  informed  decisions  after  considering  the  pros  and  cons  
of  subjecting  themselves  to  temporarily  stressful  aspects  of  treatment.  Clients  
should  be  informed  that  they  can  terminate  exposure  if  they  experience  a  high  
level of anxiety.
The  repeated  success  of  exposure  therapy  in  treating  various  disorders  has  
resulted in exposure being used as a part of most behavioral treatments for anxiety 
disorders. Spiegler (2016) notes that exposure therapies are among the most potent 
behavioral  procedures  available  for  anxiety-related  disorders,  and  they  can  have  
long-lasting effects. However, he adds, using exposure as a single treatment proce-
dure  is  not  always  sufficient.  In  cases  involving  severe  and  multifaceted  disorders,  
more than one behavioral intervention is often required. This is especially true with 
posttraumatic stress disorders. Increasingly, imaginal and in vivo exposure are being 
used in combination, which fits with the trend in behavior therapy to use treatment 
packages as a way to enhance the effectiveness of therapy.

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
eye  movement  desensitization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  is  a  form  of  
exposure therapy that entails assessment and preparation, imaginal flooding, and 
cognitive  restructuring  in  the  treatment  of  individuals  with  traumatic  memories.  
According to Shapiro and Solomon (2015), “EMDR is an integrative psychothera-
peutic approach that conceptualizes current mental health problems as emanating 
from past experiences that have been maladaptively stored neurophysiologically as 
unprocessed memories” (p. 303). The treatment involves the use of rapid, rhythmic 
eye movements and other bilateral stimulation to treat clients who have experienced 
traumatic stress. “EMDR comprises eight phases and a three-pronged methodology 
to identify and process (1) memories of past adverse life experiences that underlie 
present problems, (2) current situations that elicit disturbance, and (3) needed skills 
that will provide positive memory templates to guide the client’s future behavior” 
(p.  389).  Developed  by  Francine  Shapiro  (2001),  this  therapeutic  procedure  draws  
from a wide range of behavioral interventions. Designed to assist clients in dealing 
with posttraumatic stress disorders, EMDR has been applied to a variety of popula-
tions including children, couples, sexual abuse victims, combat veterans, victims of 
crime, rape survivors, accident victims, and individuals dealing with anxiety, panic, 
depression, grief, addictions, and phobias.
Shapiro (2001) emphasizes the importance of the safety and welfare of the cli-
ent when using this approach. EMDR may appear simple to some, but the ethical 
use of the procedure demands training and clinical supervision, as is true of using 
exposure  therapies  in  general.  Because  of  the  powerful  reactions  from  clients,  it  is  
essential that practitioners know how to safely and effectively manage these occur-
rences. Therapists should not use this procedure unless they receive proper training 
and supervision from an authorized EMDR instructor. A more complete discussion 
of this behavioral procedure can be found in Shapiro (2001, 2002a).
There  is  some  controversy  over  whether  the  eye  movements  themselves  create  
change  or  whether  cognitive  techniques  paired  with  eye  movements  act  as  change  
agents.  The  role  of  lateral  eye  movements  has  yet  to  be  clearly  demonstrated,  and  
some  evidence  indicates  that  the  eye  movement  component  may  not  be  integral  
to the treatment (Prochaska & Norcross, 2014; Speigler, 2016). In a review of con-
trolled studies of EMDR in the treatment of trauma, Shapiro (2002b) reports that 
EMDR clearly outperforms no treatment and achieves similar or superior results to 
other methods of treating trauma. Shapiro and Solomon (2015) state that extensive 
research  has  validated  EMDR  and  randomized  trials  have  confirmed  that  EMDR  
is both effective and efficient. Twelve sessions with combat veterans resulted in the 
elimination  of  PTSD  diagnosis  in  more  than  77%  of  the  cases.  When  it  comes  to  
the  overall  effectiveness  of  EMDR,  Prochaska  and  Norcross  (2014)  note  that  “in  
its  25-year  history,  EMDR  has  garnered  more  controlled  research  than  any  other  
method used to treat trauma” (p. 210). In writing about the future of EMDR, Pro-
chaska and Norcross make several predictions: increasing numbers of practitioners 
will receive training in EMDR; outcome research will shed light on EMDR’s effec-
tiveness compared to other current therapies for trauma; and further research and 
practice will provide a sense of its effectiveness with disorders beyond posttraumatic 
stress disorder.

Social Skills Training
social skills training is a broad category that deals with an individual’s abil-
ity to interact effectively with others in various social situations; it is used to help 
clients  develop  and  achieve  skills  in  interpersonal  competence.  Social  skills  involve  
being able to communicate with others in a way that is both appropriate and effec-
tive.  Individuals  who  experience  psychosocial  problems  that  are  partly  caused  by  
interpersonal  difficulties  are  good  candidates  for  social  skills  training.  Typically,  
social  skills  training  involves  various  behavioral  techniques  such  as  psychoeduca-
tion, modeling, behavior rehearsal, and feedback (Antony & Roemer, 2011b). Social 
skills  training  is  effective  in  treating  psychosocial  problems  by  increasing  clients’  
interpersonal  skills  (Kress  &  Henry,  2015;  Segrin,  2008).  Some  of  the  desirable  
aspects of social skills training are that it has a very broad base of applicability and 
that it can easily be tailored to suit the particular needs of individual clients.
Key elements of social skills training include assessment, direct instruction and 
coaching, modeling, role playing, and homework assignments (Segrin 2008). Clients 
learn information that they can apply to various interpersonal situations, and skills 
are  modeled  for  them  so  they  can  actually  see  how  skills  can  be  used.  A  key  step  
involves  clients  putting  into  action  the  information  they  are  acquiring.  Individu-
als actively practice desired behaviors through role playing. Feedback and reinforce-
ment assist clients in conceptualizing and using a new set of social skills that enables 
them to communicate more effectively. If clients are able to correct their problem-
atic behaviors in practice situations, they can then apply these new skills in daily life 
(Kress & Henry, 2015). A follow-up phase is critical for clients in establishing a range 
of effective behaviors that can be applied to many social situations.
A few examples of evidence-based applications of social skills training include 
alcohol/substance  abuse,  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  bullying,  social  
anxiety,  emotional  and  behavioral  problems  in  children,  behavioral  treatment  for  
couples, and depression (Antony & Roemer, 2011b; Segrin, 2008). A popular varia-
tion of social skills training is anger management training, which is designed for indi-
viduals who have trouble with aggressive behavior.
Self-Management Programs and Self-Directed Behavior
For some time there has been a trend toward “giving psychology away.” This 
involves psychologists being willing to share their knowledge so that “consumers” 
can increasingly lead self-directed lives and not be dependent on experts to deal with 
their  problems.  Psychologists  who  share  this  perspective  are  primarily  concerned  
with teaching people the skills they will need to manage their own lives effectively. 
An  advantage  of  self-management  techniques  is  that  treatment  can  be  extended  
to consumers in ways that cannot be done with traditional approaches to therapy. 
Another  advantage  is  that  costs  are  minimal.  Because  clients  have  a  direct  role  in  
their own treatment, techniques aimed at self-change tend to increase involvement 
and commitment to their treatment.
The basic idea of self-management assessments and interventions is that change 
can be brought about by teaching people to use coping skills in problematic situa-
tions. 
self-management  strategies  include  teaching  clients  how  to  select  realistic  
goals,  how  to  translate  these  goals  into  target  behaviors,  how  to  create  an  action

plan for change, and ways to self-monitor and evaluate their actions (Kress & Henry 
2015). Generalization and maintenance of the outcomes are enhanced by encourag-
ing clients to accept the responsibility for carrying out these strategies in daily life.
In self-management programs people make decisions concerning specific behav-
iors they want to control or change. People frequently discover that a major reason 
they do not attain their goals is the lack of certain skills or unrealistic expectations 
of  change.  Hope  can  be  a  therapeutic  factor  that  leads  to  change,  but  unrealistic  
hope  can  pave  the  way  for  a  pattern  of  failures  in  a  self-change  program.  A  self-
directed approach can provide the guidelines for change and a realistic plan that will 
lead to change.
If  you  want  to  succeed  in  such  a  program,  a  careful  analysis  of  the  context  of  
the behavior pattern is essential, and you must be willing to follow some basic steps 
such as these provided by Watson and Tharp (2014):
1.
 Selecting goals. Goals should be established one at a time, and they 
should be measurable, attainable, positive, and significant for you. It is 
essential that expectations be realistic.
2.
 Translating goals into target behaviors. Identify behaviors targeted for 
change. Once targets for change are selected, anticipate obstacles and 
think of ways to negotiate them.
3.
 Self-monitoring. Deliberately and systematically observe your own 
behavior, and keep a behavioral diary in which you record your actions, 
thoughts, and feelings along with comments about the relevant ante-
cedent cues and consequences. This diary can help you identify what 
you need to change.
4.
 Working out a plan for change. A good plan involves substituting new 
thoughts and behaviors for ineffective thoughts and behaviors. Devise an 
action program to bring about actual changes that are in line with your 
goals. Various plans for the same goal can be designed, each of which 
can be effective. Some type of self-reinforcement system is necessary in 
this plan because reinforcement is the cornerstone of modern behavior 
therapy. Discover and select reinforcers to use until the new behaviors 
have been implemented in everyday life. Practice the new behaviors you 
want to acquire or refine, and take steps to ensure that the gains made 
will be maintained.
5.
 Evaluating an action plan. Evaluate the plan for change to determine 
whether goals are being achieved, and adjust and revise the plan as 
other ways to meet goals are learned. Be willing to adjust your plan as 
conditions change. Evaluation is an ongoing process rather than a one-
time occurrence, and self-change is a lifelong practice.
Self-management  strategies  have  been  successfully  applied  to  many  popula-
tions  and  problems,  a  few  of  which  include  coping  with  panic  attacks,  reducing  
perfectionism,  helping  children  to  cope  with  fear  of  the  dark,  increasing  creative  
productivity, managing anxiety in social situations, encouraging speaking in front 
of  a  class,  increasing  exercise,  reducing  conflict  with  coworkers,  improving  study  
habits, control of smoking, and dealing with depression (Watson & Tharp, 2014). 
Research  on  self-management  has  been  conducted  in  a  wide  variety  of  health

Multimodal Therapy: Clinical Behavior Therapy
Multimodal  therapy  is  a  comprehensive,  systematic,  holistic  approach  to  behav-
ior  therapy  developed  by  the  late  Arnold  Lazarus  (1989,1997,  2005,  2008a),  a  key  
pioneer in clinical behavior therapy. Multimodal therapy is grounded in social cog-
nitive learning theory. The assessment process is multimodal, yet the treatment is 
cognitive behavioral and draws upon empirically supported methods. It is an open 
system that encourages technical eclecticism in that it applies diverse behavioral tech-
niques from a variety of theories to a wide range of problems. Whenever possible, 
multimodal  therapists  strive  to  incorporate  empirically  supported  and  evidence-
based treatments in their practice (Lazarus & Lazarus, 2015). This approach serves 
as  a  major  link  between  some  behavioral  principles  and  the  cognitive  behavioral  
approach that has largely replaced traditional behavioral therapy.
Multimodal  therapists  borrow  techniques  from  many  other  therapy  systems,  
but  Lazarus  and  Lazarus  (2015)  point  out  that  these  techniques  are  never  used  in  
a  shotgun  manner:  “a  rag-tag  combination  of  techniques  without  a  sound  ratio-
nale will likely result only in syncretistic confusion” (p. 682). Multimodal therapists 
take great pains to determine precisely what relationship and what treatment strate-
gies will work best with each client and under which particular circumstances. The 
underlying  assumption  of  this  approach  is  that  because  individuals  are  troubled  
by  a  variety  of  specific  problems  it  is  appropriate  that  a  multitude  of  treatment  
strategies be used in bringing about change. Therapeutic flexibility and versatility, 
along  with  breadth  over  depth,  are  highly  valued,  and  multimodal  therapists  are  
constantly adjusting their procedures to achieve the client’s goals. Therapists need 
to decide when and how to be challenging or supportive and how to adapt their rela-
tionship style to the needs of the client. The therapeutic relationship is the soil that 
enables  techniques  to  take  root,  and  multimodal  therapists  recognize  that  a  good  
working  alliance  is  a  cornerstone  in  the  foundation  of  effective  therapeutic  prac-
tice (Lazarus & Lazarus, 2015). Multimodal therapists tend to be very active during 
therapist sessions, functioning as trainers, educators, consultants, coaches, and role 
models.  They  provide  information,  instruction,  and  feedback  as  well  as  modeling  
assertive behaviors. They offer suggestions, positive reinforcements, and are appro-
priately self-disclosing.
For an illustration of how Dr. Lazarus applies the BASIC I.D. assessment model 
to  the  case  of  Ruth,  along  with  examples  of  various  techniques  he  uses,  see  Case 
Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 7).
Mindfulness and Acceptance-Based Approaches
The third generation (or “third wave”) of behavior therapy emphasizes con-
siderations  that  were  considered  off  limits  for  behavior  therapists  until  recently,  
including  mindfulness,  acceptance,  the  therapeutic  relationship,  spirituality,  val-
ues,  meditation,  being  in  the  present  moment,  and  emotional  expression  (Hayes,  
Follette,  &  Linehan,  2004;  Herbert  &  Forman,  2011).  Third-generation  behavior

therapies center around five interrelated core themes: (1) an expanded view of psy-
chological  health,  (2)  a  broad  view  of  acceptable  outcomes  in  therapy,  (3)  accep-
tance, (4) mindfulness, and (5) creating a life worth living (Speigler, 2016).
Mindfulness is “the awareness that emerges through having attention on pur-
pose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience 
moment  by  moment”  (Kabat-Zinn,  2003,  p.  145).  In  mindfulness  practice,  clients  
train  themselves  to  intentionally  focus  on  their  “present  experience  with  accep-
tance”  (Siegel,  2010,  p.  27)  and  develop  an  attitude  of  curiosity  and  compassion  
toward present experience.
Mindfulness shows promise across a broad range of clinical problems, includ-
ing the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders, relationship problems, substance 
abuse,  and  psychophysiological  disorders  (Germer,  Siegel,  &  Fulton,  2013).  It  is  
useful in treating posttraumatic stress disorder among military veterans. Through 
mindfulness  exercises,  veterans  may  be  better  able  to  observe  repetitive  negative  
thinking  and  prevent  extensive  engagement  with  maladaptive  ruminative  pro-
cesses  (Vujanovic,  Niles,  Pietrefesa,  Schmertz,  &  Potter,  2011).  Many  therapeutic  
approaches are incorporating mindfulness and meditation, as well as other contem-
plative practices, in the counseling process, and this trend seems likely to continue 
(Worthington, 2011).
acceptance  is  a  process  involving  receiving  one’s  present  experience  without  
judgment or preference, but with curiosity and kindness, and striving for full aware-
ness  of  the  present  moment  (Germer,  2013).  Acceptance  is  an  alternative  way  of  
responding to our internal experience. By replacing judgment, criticism, and avoid-
ance with acceptance, the likely result is increased adaptive functioning (Antony & 
Roemer, 2011b). Mindfulness and acceptance approaches are also good avenues for 
the integration of spirituality in the counseling process.
For  an  extensive  discussion  of  mindfulness  and  acceptance,  see  Acceptance  and  
Mindfulness in Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Understanding and Applying the New Therapies 
(Herbert & Forman, 2011).
Recent  developments  in  the  cognitive  behavioral  tradition  include  four  major  
approaches: (1) dialectical behavior therapy, which has become a recognized treatment 
for  borderline  personality  disorder  (Linehan,  1993a,  1993b,  2015);  (2)  mindfulness-
based  stress  reduction,  an  8-  to  10-week  group  program  that  applies  mindfulness  
techniques to coping with stress and promoting physical and psychological health 
(Kabat-Zinn,  1990,  2003);  (3)  mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy,  aimed  primarily  at  
treating depression (Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2013); and (4) acceptance and commit-
ment therapy, which encourages clients to accept unpleasant sensations rather than 
attempting to control or change them (Hayes, Strosahl, & Houts, 2005; Hayes, Stro-
sahl, & Wilson, 2011). All four of these approaches use mindfulness strategies that 
have been subjected to empirical scrutiny, a hallmark of the behavioral tradition.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Dialectical behavior therapy was originally 
developed  to  treat  chronically  suicidal  individuals  diagnosed  with  borderline  
personality  disorder  (BPD),  and  it  is  now  recognized  as  a  major  psychological  
treatment for this population. Formulated by Linehan (1993a, 1993b, 2015), who 
was  motivated  to  alleviate  emotional  suffering  for  those  miserable  enough  to  
consider suicide, DBT has been proven effective in treating a wide range of disorders,

including substance dependence, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
eating disorders, suicidal behavior, and nonsuicidal self-injury (Linehan, 2015).
DBT is a promising blend of behavioral and psychoanalytic techniques for treat-
ing  borderline  personality  disorders.  Like  analytic  therapy,  DBT  emphasizes  the  
importance of the psychotherapeutic relationship, validation of the client, the etio-
logic importance of the client having experienced an “invalidating environment” as 
a child, and confrontation of resistance. DBT treatment includes both acceptance- 
and  change-oriented  strategies.  Mindfulness  procedures  are  taught  to  develop  an  
attitude  of  acceptance  (Fishman,  Rego,  &  Muller,  2011;  Kuo  &  Fitzpatrick,  2015).
The  treatment  program  is  geared  toward  helping  clients  make  changes  in  their  
behavior  and  environment  while  communicating  acceptance  of  their  current  state  
(Kuo & Fitzpatrick, 2015; Robins & Rosenthal, 2011). To help clients who have par-
ticular  problems  with  emotional  regulation,  DBT  teaches  clients  to  recognize  and  
accept the existence of simultaneous, opposing forces. By acknowledging this fun-
damental dialectic relationship—such as not wanting to engage in a certain behav-
ior, yet knowing they have to engage in the behavior if they want to achieve a desired 
goal—clients can learn to integrate the opposing notions of acceptance and change, 
and the therapist can teach clients how to regulate their emotions and behaviors.
DBT  skills  training  is  not  a  “quick  fix”  approach.  It  generally  involves  a  mini-
mum of one year of treatment and includes both individual therapy and skills train-
ing  done  in  a  group.  DBT  is  an  empirically  supported  intervention  that  employs  
behavioral and cognitive behavioral techniques, including a form of exposure ther-
apy  in  which  the  client  learns  to  tolerate  painful  emotions  without  enacting  self-
destructive  behaviors.  DBT  draws  upon  Zen  teachings  and  practices  to  integrate  
mindfulness and acceptance-based techniques in therapy (Kuo & Fitzpatrick, 2015). 
Some of the Zen Buddhist principles and practices include being aware of the pres-
ent moment, seeing reality without distortion, accepting reality without judgment, 
letting  go  of  attachments  that  result  in  suffering,  developing  a  greater  degree  of  
acceptance of self and others, and entering fully into present activities without sepa-
rating oneself from ongoing events and interactions (Robins & Rosenthal, 2011).
DBT promotes a structured, predictable therapeutic environment. The goals are 
tailored  to  each  individual.  Therapists  assist  clients  in  using  whatever  skills  they  
possess  or  are  learning  to  navigate  crises  more  effectively  and  to  address  problem  
behaviors (Robins & Rosenthal, 2011). Skills are taught in four modules: mindful-
ness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation, and distress tolerance (Kuo 
& Fitzpatrick, 2015).
Mindfulness is a fundamental skill in DBT that teaches individuals to be aware 
of and accept the world as it is and to respond to each moment effectively. Through 
mindfulness, clients learn to embrace and tolerate the intense emotions they experi-
ence when facing distressing situations. Interpersonal effectiveness teaches clients to ask 
for what they need and how to say “no” while maintaining self-respect and relation-
ships with others. This skill entails increasing the chances that a client’s goals will 
be met, while at the same time not damaging the relationship. Emotional regulation 
includes  identifying  emotions,  identifying  obstacles  to  changing  emotions,  reduc-
ing  vulnerability,  and  increasing  positive  emotions.  Clients  learn  the  benefits  of  
regulating emotions such as anger, depression, and anxiety. Distress tolerance is aimed 
at  helping  individuals  to  calmly  recognizing  emotions  associated  with  negative

situations without becoming overwhelmed by these situations. Clients learn how to 
tolerate pain or discomfort skillfully.
DBT helps individuals acquire, strengthen, and generalize the skills they learn in 
therapy to their daily environments (Kuo & Fitzpatrick, 2015). Because DBT places 
heavy emphasis on didactic instruction and teaching mindfulness skills, therapists 
must  obtain  training  to  become  competent  in  applying  these  skills  and  be  able  to  
model  specific  strategies  and  attitudes  for  clients.  Therapists  who  want  to  employ  
mindfulness  strategies  must  also  have  personal  understanding  of  these  interven-
tions to be able to effectively use them with clients.
For  a  more  detailed  review  of  DBT,  see  DBT  Skills  Training  Manual  (Linehan,  
2015),  which  includes  instructions  for  orienting  clients  to  DBT  and  explains  how  
to use many skills in DBT. Another useful resource for a more detailed discussion of 
DBT is Robins and Rosenthal (2011).
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Jon Kabat-Zinn, at the University 
of  Massachusetts,  developed  MBSR  in  1979  to  see  if  it  was  possible  to  create  a  
training program to relieve medical patients of stress, pain, illness, and other forms 
of  suffering.  The  eight-week  structured  group  program  involves  training  people  
in  mindfulness  meditation,  and  today  instructors  are  often  not  mental  health  
clinicians. Originally designed to help people increase their responsibility for their 
own  well-being  and  to  actively  develop  inner  resources  for  treating  their  physical  
health concerns (Kabat-Zinn, 2003), MBSR is not a form of psychotherapy per se, 
but it can be an adjunct to therapy.
The  essence  of  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR)  consists  of  the  
notion  that  much  of  our  distress  and  suffering  results  from  continually  wanting  
things  to  be  different  from  how  they  actually  are  (Salmon,  Sephton,  &  Dreeben,  
2011). MBSR assists people in learning how to live more fully in the present rather 
than ruminating about the past or being overly concerned about the future. MBSR 
does not actively teach cognitive modification techniques, nor does it label certain 
cognitions as “dysfunctional,” because this is not consistent with the nonjudgmen-
tal attitude one strives to cultivate in mindfulness practice.
The approach adopted in the MBSR program is to develop the capacity for sus-
tained directed attention through formal and informal meditation practice. There 
is a heavy emphasis on experiential learning and the process of client self-discovery 
(Dimidjian & Linehan, 2008). In formal practice, skills taught include sitting medi-
tation and mindful yoga, which are aimed at cultivating mindfulness. The program 
includes a body scan meditation, which helps clients to observe all the sensations in 
their body. Clients are encouraged to bring mindfulness into all of their daily activi-
ties, and this informal practice includes being mindful when standing, walking, eat-
ing,  and  doing  chores.  Those  who  are  involved  in  the  program  are  encouraged  to  
practice formal mindfulness meditation for 45 minutes daily.
The  MBSR  program  is  designed  to  teach  participants  to  relate  to  external  and  
internal sources of stress in constructive ways, and an ongoing commitment to culti-
vate and practice its principles in each moment is required. Acquiring a mindful way of 
being is not a simple behavioral technique but is more like an art form that individu-
als develop over time as they deepen their focus through disciplined practice. Kabat-
Zinn (2003) makes it clear that mindfulness is not about getting anywhere or fixing

anything: “It is an invitation to allow oneself to be where one already is and to know 
the inner and outer landscape of the direct experience in each moment” (p. 148).
MBSR programs are offered in hospitals, clinics, schools, workplaces, corporate 
offices, law schools, prisons, and inner-city health centers (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). MBSR 
has  many  clinical  applications,  and  it  is  expected  that  the  approach  will  evolve  to  
address a range of negative psychological states, such as anxiety, stress, and depres-
sion. This approach has many applications in the area of health and wellness and in 
promoting healthy lifestyle changes. Numerous research reviews and meta-analyses 
indicate that mindfulness, acceptance, and compassion-based treatments are effec-
tive  in  promoting  physical  and  psychological  health  (Germer,  2013).  One  of  these  
studies suggests that MBSR training may lead to changes in the brain that result in 
people being able to better cope with negative emotional reactions under stress (as 
cited in Kabat-Zinn, 2003).
Kabat-Zinn’s (1990, 1994) books offer a comprehensive treatment of MBSR, and 
they did a great deal to popularize the program he developed. An excellent resource 
for a more detailed treatment of MBSR is Salmon, Sephton, and Dreeben (2011).
Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive  Therapy  (MBCT)  This  program  is  a  comprehensive  
integration  of  the  principles  and  skills  of  mindfulness  applied  to  the  treatment  of  
depression  (Segal  et  al.,  2013).  MBCT  is  an  eight-week  group  treatment  program  of  
two-hour  weekly  sessions  adapted  from  Kabat-Zinn’s  (1990,  2003)  mindfulness-based  
stress reduction program. The program integrates techniques from MBSR with teaching 
cognitive behavioral skills to clients. The primary aim is to change clients’ awareness of 
and relation to their negative thoughts. Participants are taught how to respond in skillful 
and intentional ways to their automatic negative thought patterns (Hammond, 2015).
Segal,  Williams,  and  Teasdale  (2013)  describe  kindness  and  self-compassion  as  
essential components of MBCT. Mindfulness is a way of developing self-compassion, 
which  is  a  form  of  self-care  when  facing  difficult  situations.  Mindfulness  practices  
focus  on  moment-to-moment  experiencing  and  assist  clients  in  developing  an  atti-
tude of open awareness and acceptance of what is rather than being self-critical. When 
we  acknowledge  our  shortcomings  without  critical  judgment,  we  can  begin  to  treat  
ourselves with kindness. We can intentionally activate goodwill toward ourselves and 
others while experiencing emotions such as anger, anxiety, and depression. Research 
has shown that self-compassion is positively associated with emotional well-being and 
decreased  levels  of  anxiety  and  depression  (Morgan,  Morgan,  &  Germer,  2013;  Neff,  
2012). Other research findings on the association between self-compassion and emo-
tional well-being have been reported by Neff (2012):
Self-compassionate people recognize when they are suffering, yet they 
are kind toward themselves in these moments.
Self-compassion is associated with greater wisdom and emotional 
intelligence.
Self-compassion is associated with feelings of life satisfaction and con-
nection to others.
Self-compassionate individuals tend to experience increased happiness, 
optimism, curiosity, and positive emotions.
Self-compassion engenders compassion toward others.

Morgan,  Morgan,  and  Germer  (2013)  report  that  there  is  ample  evidence  that  
mindfulness meditation enhances the ability to pay attention in a concentrated and 
sustained manner. Being able to attend to present experiencing is a route to devel-
oping compassion toward oneself and expressing compassion toward others. Mind-
fulness is something that is caught more than something that is taught. The attitude 
and behavior of the instructor/facilitator of the MBCT group are critical in helping 
participants acquire an accepting way of being and discarding self-critical and judg-
mental habits.
Segal, Williams, and Teasdale (2013) describe the essence of eight sessions in the 
MBCT program:
Therapy begins by identifying negative automatic thinking of people 
experiencing depression and by introducing some basic mindfulness 
practices.
In the second session, participants learn about the reactions they have 
to life experiences and learn more about mindfulness practices. Clients 
learn the importance of kindness and self-compassion, both to self and 
to others.
The third session is focused on gathering the scattered mind; partici-
pants learn breathing techniques and focus their attention on their 
present experiencing. Clients learn how to anchor thoughts with a 
focus on the breath while allowing experience to unfold.
In session four, the emphasis is on learning to experience the moment 
without becoming attached to outcomes; participants practice sitting 
meditation and mindful walking.
The fifth session teaches participants how to accept their experiencing 
without holding on; participants learn the value of allowing and letting be.
Session six is used to describe thoughts as “merely thoughts”; clients 
learn that they do not have to act on their thoughts. They can tell them-
selves, “I am not my thoughts” and “Thoughts are not facts.”
In session seven, participants learn how to take care of themselves and 
to develop an action plan to deal with the threat of relapse.
Session eight focuses on maintaining and extending new learning; clients 
learn how to generalize their mindfulness practices to daily life.
MBCT emphasizes experiential learning, in-session practice, learning from feed-
back, completing homework assignments, and applying what is learned in the pro-
gram to challenging situations encountered outside of the sessions. The brevity of 
MBCT  makes  this  approach  an  efficient  and  cost-effective  treatment.  For  a  more  
detailed review of MBCT, see Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (Segal 
et al., 2013).
Acceptance  and  Commitment  Therapy  (ACT)  Another  mindfulness-based  
approach  is  acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (Hayes  et  al.,  2005,  2011).  ACT  is  a  
unique  empirically  based  psychological  intervention  that  uses  acceptance  and  
mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, 
to increase psychological flexibility. ACT involves fully accepting present experience 
and  mindfully  letting  go  of  obstacles.  In  this  approach  “acceptance  is  not  merely

tolerance—rather  it  is  the  active  nonjudgmental  embracing  of  experience  in  the  
here and now” (Hayes, 2004, p. 32). Acceptance is a stance or posture from which 
to  conduct  therapy  and  from  which  a  client  can  conduct  life  that  provides  an  
alternative to contemporary forms of cognitive behavioral therapy. In contrast to the 
cognitive  behavioral  approaches  discussed  in  Chapter  10,  in  which  dysfunctional  
thoughts are identified and challenged, in ACT there is little emphasis on changing 
the content of a client’s thoughts. Hayes has found that confronting maladaptive 
cognitions strengthens rather than reduces these cognitions. Instead, the emphasis 
is on acceptance (nonjudgmental awareness) of cognitions. The goal is for individuals 
to become aware of and examine their thoughts. Clients learn how to change their 
relationship  to  their  thoughts.  They  learn  how  to  accept  yet  not  identify  with  
thoughts and feelings they may have been trying to deny.
Values are a basic part of the therapeutic process, and the work of ACT depends 
on what an individual wants and values. Client and therapist work together to identify 
personal values in areas such as work, relationships, spirituality, and well-being (Bat-
ten & Cairrochi, 2015). ACT practitioners might ask clients, “What do you want your 
life to stand for?” Therapy involves assisting clients to choose values they want to live 
by, designing specific goals, and taking steps to achieve their goals (Speigler, 2016).
A  commitment  to  action  is  essential,  and  clients  are  asked  to  make  mindful  
decisions about what they are willing to do to live a valued and meaningful life. Con-
crete homework and behavioral exercises as two ways clients can commit to action. 
For example, one form of homework asks clients to write down life goals or things 
they value in various aspects of their lives. Clients learn to allow experience to come 
and go while they pursue a meaningful life.
ACT  is  an  effective  form  of  therapy  that  continues  to  influence  the  practice  
of  behavior  therapy.  Germer  (2013)  suggests  “mindfulness  appears  to  be  drawing  
clinical  theory,  research,  and  practice  closer  together,  and  helping  to  integrate  the  
private and professional lives of therapists” (p. 13). ACT emphasizes common pro-
cesses across clinical disorders, which makes it easier to learn basic treatment skills. 
Practitioners can then implement basic principles in diverse and creative ways. ACT 
has been empirically shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of disorders, 
including substance abuse, depression, anxiety, phobias, posttraumatic stress disor-
der, and chronic pain (Batten & Cairrochi, 2015).
For  an  in-depth  discussion  of  the  role  of  mindfulness  in  psychotherapeutic  
practice, four highly recommended books are Acceptance and Mindfulness in Cognitive 
Behavior  Therapy:  Understanding  and  Applying  the  New  Therapies  (Herbert  &  Forman,  
2011), Mindfulness and Acceptance: Expanding the Cognitive-Behavioral Tradition (Hayes et 
al., 2004), Mindfulness and Psychotherapy (Germer et al., 2013), and Wisdom and Compas-
sion in Psychotherapy: Deepening Mindfulness in Clinical Practice, (Germer & Siegel, 2012).
Application to Group Counseling
Behavioral group therapy incorporates classical behavior therapy treatment 
principles rooted in classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learn-
ing theory. The focus of a behavioral group is on teaching, modeling, and applying 
scientific  principles  to  target  specific  behaviors  for  change  (Kress  &  Henry,  2015).

Group-based  behavioral  approaches  emphasize  teaching  clients  self-management  
skills  and  a  range  of  new  coping  behaviors,  as  well  as  how  to  restructure  their  
thoughts. Clients can learn to use these techniques to control their lives, deal effec-
tively with present and future problems, and function well after they complete their 
group experience. Many groups are designed primarily to increase the client’s degree 
of control and freedom in specific aspects of daily life.
Group leaders who function within a behavioral framework may develop tech-
niques from various theoretical viewpoints. Behavioral practitioners make use of a 
brief, active, directive, structured, collaborative, psychoeducational model of therapy 
that relies on empirical validation of its concepts and techniques. The leader follows 
the progress of group members through the ongoing collection of data before, dur-
ing, and after all interventions. Such an approach provides both the group leader and 
the  members  with  continuous  feedback  about  therapeutic  progress.  Today,  many  
groups in community agencies demand this kind of accountability.
Behavioral  group  therapy  has  some  unique  characteristics  that  set  it  apart  
from  most  of  the  other  group  approaches.  A  distinguishing  characteristic  of  
behavioral  practitioners  is  their  systematic  adherence  to  specification  and  mea-
surement. The specific unique characteristics of behavioral group therapy include 
(1)  conducting  a  behavioral  assessment,  (2)  precisely  spelling  out  collaborative  
treatment  goals,  (3)  formulating  a  specific  treatment  procedure  appropriate  to  
a  particular  problem,  and  (4)  objectively  evaluating  the  outcomes  of  therapy.  
Behavior therapists tend to utilize short-term, time-limited interventions aimed 
at efficiently and effectively solving problems and assisting members in develop-
ing new skills.
Behavioral group leaders assume the role of teacher and encourage members to 
learn and practice skills in the group that they can apply to everyday living. Group 
leaders  typically  assume  an  active,  directive,  and  supportive  role  in  the  group  and  
apply their knowledge of behavioral principles and skills to the resolution of prob-
lems. They model active participation and collaboration by their involvement with 
members in creating an agenda, designing homework, and teaching skills and new 
behaviors. Leaders carefully observe and assess behavior to determine the conditions 
that  are  related  to  certain  problems  and  the  conditions  that  will  facilitate  change.  
Members in behavioral groups identify specific skills that they lack or would like to 
enhance. Assertiveness and social skills training fit well into a group format. Relax-
ation procedures, behavioral rehearsal, modeling, coaching, meditation, and mind-
fulness  techniques  are  often  incorporated  in  behavioral  groups.  The  experience  of  
being mindful is expanded in the group setting where people meditate and are still 
in the presence of others. Most of the other techniques described earlier in this chap-
ter can be applied to group work.
Today, most behavior therapy groups blend cognitive and behavioral concepts 
and techniques, with few having a strictly behavioral focus (Kress & Henry, 2015). 
There  are  many  different  types  of  groups  with  a  behavioral  twist,  or  groups  that  
blend  both  behavioral  and  cognitive  methods  for  specific  populations.  Structured  
groups,  with  a  psychoeducational  focus,  are  especially  popular  in  various  settings  
today. At least four general approaches can be applied to the practice of behavioral 
groups: (1) social skills training groups, (2) psychoeducational groups with specific

Behavior Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Behavior  therapy  has  some  clear  advantages  over  many  other  theories  in  
counseling  culturally  diverse  clients.  Because  of  their  cultural  and  ethnic  back-
grounds, some clients hold values that are contrary to the free expression of feelings 
and the sharing of personal concerns. Behavioral counseling does not generally place 
emphasis on experiencing catharsis. Rather, it stresses changing specific behaviors 
and developing problem-solving skills. Some potential strengths of the behavioral 
approaches  in  working  with  diverse  client  populations  include  its  specificity,  task  
orientation, focus on objectivity, focus on cognition and behavior, action orienta-
tion, dealing with the present more than the past, emphasis on brief interventions, 
teaching coping strategies, and problem-solving orientation. The attention given to 
transfer of learning and the principles and strategies for maintaining new behavior 
in daily life are crucial. Clients who are looking for action plans and specific behav-
ioral change are likely to cooperate with this approach because they can see that it 
offers them concrete methods for dealing with their problems of living.
Behavior therapy focuses on environmental conditions that contribute to a cli-
ent’s problems. Social and political influences can play a significant role in the lives 
of  people  of  color  through  discriminatory  practices  and  economic  problems,  and  
the behavioral approach takes into consideration the social and cultural dimensions 
of the client’s life. Behavior therapy is based on an experimental analysis of behavior 
in  the  client’s  own  social  environment  and  gives  special  attention  to  a  number  of  
specific conditions: the client’s cultural conception of problem behaviors, establish-
ing specific therapeutic goals, arranging conditions to increase the client’s expecta-
tion of successful therapeutic outcomes, and employing appropriate social influence 
agents (Tanaka-Matsumi, Higginbotham, & Chang, 2002). The foundation of ethi-
cal practice involves a therapist’s familiarity with the client’s culture, as well as the 
competent  application  of  this  knowledge  in  formulating  assessment,  diagnostic,  
and treatment strategies.
The behavioral approach has moved beyond treating clients for a specific symp-
tom or behavioral problem. Instead, it stresses a thorough assessment of the person’s 
life circumstances to ascertain not only what conditions give rise to the client’s prob-
lems but also whether the target behavior is amenable to change and whether such a 
change is likely to lead to a significant improvement in the client’s total life situation.
In  designing  a  change  program  for  clients  from  diverse  backgrounds,  effective  
behavioral  practitioners  conduct  a  functional  analysis  of  the  problem  situation.  This  
assessment includes the cultural context in which the problem behavior occurs, the con-
sequences both to the client and to the client’s sociocultural environment, the resources 
within the environment that can promote change, and the impact that change is likely 
to  have  on  others  in  the  client’s  social  surroundings.  Assessment  methods  should  be

chosen with the client’s cultural background in mind (Spiegler, 2016; Tanaka-Matsumi 
et al., 2002). Counselors must be knowledgeable as well as open and sensitive to issues 
such as these: What is considered normal and abnormal behavior in the client’s culture? 
What are the client’s culturally based conceptions of his or her problems? What is the 
potential  role  of  spirituality  or  religion  in  the  client’s  life?  What  kind  of  information  
about the client is essential in making an accurate assessment?
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Although behavior therapy is sensitive to differences among clients in a broad sense, 
behavior therapists need to become more responsive to specific issues pertaining to 
all forms of diversity. Because race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation are crit-
ical variables that influence the process and outcome of therapy, it is essential that 
behavior therapists pay careful attention to these factors and address social justice 
issues as they arise in a client’s therapy.
Some behavioral counselors may focus on using a variety of techniques in narrowly 
treating specific behavioral problems. Instead of viewing clients in the context of their 
sociocultural  environment,  these  practitioners  concentrate  too  much  on  problems  
within the individual. In doing so they may overlook significant issues in the lives of cli-
ents. Such practitioners are not likely to bring about beneficial changes for their clients.
The fact that behavioral interventions often work well raises an interesting issue 
in  multicultural  counseling.  When  clients  make  significant  personal  changes,  it  is  
very  likely  that  others  in  their  environment  will  react  to  them  differently.  Before  
deciding too quickly on goals for therapy, the counselor and client need to discuss 
the  complexity  inherent  in  change.  It  is  essential  for  therapists  to  conduct  a  thor-
ough assessment of the interpersonal and cultural dimensions of the problem. Cli-
ents should be helped in assessing the possible consequences of some of their newly 
acquired social skills. Once goals are determined and therapy is under way, clients 
should have opportunities to talk about the problems they encounter as they bring 
new skills and behaviors into their home and work settings.

n  Stan’s  case  many  specific  and  interrelated  prob-
lems  can  be  identified  through  an  assessment  pro-
cess. Behaviorally,  he  is  defensive,  avoids  eye  contact,  
speaks  hesitantly,  uses  alcohol  excessively,  has  a  poor  
sleep pattern, and displays various avoidance behaviors 
in social and interpersonal situations. In the emotional 
area, Stan has a number of specific problems, some of 
which  include  anxiety,  panic  attacks,  depression,  fear  
of  criticism  and  rejection,  feeling  worthless  and  stu-
pid, and feeling isolated and alienated. He experiences 
a range of physiological complaints such as dizziness, 
heart palpitations, and headaches. Cognitively, he wor-
ries  about  death  and  dying,  has  many  self-defeating  
thoughts and beliefs, is governed by categorical imper-
atives (“shoulds,” “oughts,” “musts”), engages in fatal-
istic  thinking,  and  compares  himself  negatively  with  
others. In the interpersonal area, Stan is unassertive, has 
an  unsatisfactory  relationship  with  his  parents,  has  
few friends, is afraid of contact with women and fears 
intimacy, and feels socially inferior.
After completing this assessment, I focus on help-
ing Stan define the specific areas where he would like 
to make changes. Before developing a treatment plan, 
I  assist  Stan  in  understanding  the  purposes  of  his  
behavior.  I  then  educate  Stan  about  how  the  therapy  
sessions  (and  his  work  outside  of  the  sessions)  can

help him reach his goals. Early during treatment I help 
Stan translate some of his general goals into concrete 
and measurable ones. When Stan says, “I want to feel 
better  about  myself,”  I  help  him  define  more  specific  
goals. When he says, “I want to get rid of my inferior-
ity  complex,”  I  reply:  “What  exactly  do  you  mean  by  
this? What are some situations in which you feel infe-
rior? What do you actually do that leads to feelings of 
inferiority?”  Stan’s  concrete  aims  include  his  desire  
to  function  without  drugs  or  alcohol.  I  suggest  that  
he  keep  a  record  of  when  he  drinks  and  what  events  
lead  to  drinking.  My  hope  is  that  Stan  will  establish  
goals that are based on positive markers, not negative 
goals. Instead of focusing on what Stan would like to 
get rid of, I am more interested in what he would like 
to acquire and develop.
Stan indicates that he does not want to feel apolo-
getic  for  his  existence.  I  introduce  behavioral  skills  
training  because  he  has  trouble  talking  with  his  boss  
and  coworkers.  I  demonstrate  specific  skills  that  he  
can use in approaching them more directly and confi-
dently. This procedure includes modeling, role playing, 
and  behavior  rehearsal.  He  then  tries  more  effective  
behaviors with me as I play the role of the boss. I give 
him feedback on how strong or apologetic he seemed.
Imaginal exposure and systematic desensitization 
are appropriate in working with Stan’s fear of failing. 
Before using these procedures, I explain the procedure 
to Stan and get his informed consent. Stan first learns 
relaxation  procedures  during  the  sessions  and  then  
practices them daily at home. Next, he lists his specific 
fears relating to failure, and he then generates a hierar-
chy of fear items. Stan identifies his greatest fear as fear 
of dating and interacting with women. The least fear-
ful  situation  he  identifies  is  being  with  a  female  stu-
dent for whom he does not feel an attraction. I first do 
some  systematic  desensitization  on  Stan’s  hierarchy.  
Stan  begins  repeated,  systematic  exposure  to  items  
that he finds frightening, beginning at the bottom of 
the  fear  hierarchy.  He  continues  with  repeated  expo-
sure to the next fear hierarchy item when exposure to 
the previous item generates only mild fear. Part of the 
process involves exposure exercises for practice in vari-
ous situations away from the therapy office.
The  goal  of  therapy  is  to  help  Stan  modify  the  
behavior  that  results  in  his  feelings  of  guilt  and  anxi-
ety.  By  learning  more  appropriate  coping  behaviors,  
eliminating unrealistic anxiety and guilt, and acquiring 
more adaptive responses, Stan’s presenting symptoms 
decrease, and he reports a greater degree of satisfaction.

this  difficult,  but  she  hesitantly  said  she  was  willing

ask  for  help  both  at  work  and  at  home.  Gwen  is  late  
for  our  session,  and  when  she  arrives  she  looks  tired  
and defeated.
Gwen: Sorry I am late. I left work early to take my 
mother to the doctor, and the appointment ran 
longer than I expected.
Therapist: I am pleased you were able to make it, 
but our session will be shorter. Last week you 
talked about feeling disconnected from your 
husband. We agreed that asking him for assis-
tance and sharing your daily life with him might 
help you communicate with each other. What 
have you done this week to get support and share 
more at home?
Gwen:
 I expressed to colleagues that I needed help 
when completing some tasks at work, but I fell 
back into the same pattern of silence when at home 
with Ron.
Therapist: Tell me more about falling back into the 
same pattern of silence.
Gwen: I wanted to ask Ron to help with my mom, 
but ultimately I feel like she is my mom and my 
responsibility. He sees what I am doing and could 
offer to pitch in.
Therapist: You seemed eager to express your need for 
support to Ron, but then something stopped you. 
What do you think caused you to stop? [Using the 
A-B-C model]
Gwen: I hate to ask. It is my responsibility. I think I 
am the only one who can do it. I would feel like I 
was putting a burden on Ron’s shoulders if I asked 
for help.
Therapist: You must feel an overwhelming amount of 
pressure being solely responsible for so much.
Gwen: Yes, it is hard to make sense of it all.
Therapist: Let me see if I understand. It sounds 
as though taking care of your mom is your sole 
responsibility and not Ron’s [antecedent]. You 
do not want to feel like a burden to Ron, so  
you stop yourself from asking for support 
[behavior].
Gwen:
 Yes, when I get home I want to talk, but I do 
not want to become a burden on someone I love. 
So I just withdraw into myself [consequence].
Assessment  is  a  large  part  of  behavioral  therapy,  and  
reviewing homework assignments helps us to see if our 
approach is effective. Although Gwen was aware of her 
pattern of silence at home, she was not able to modify 
her behavior and express her feelings to her husband.
I  decide  to  introduce  Gwen  to  the  concept  of  
mindfulness to help her stop the automatic behaviors 
that  have  kept  her  feeling  stressed  and  overwhelmed.  
Gwen has difficulty being in the present moment, and 
she  could  profit  from  slowing  down  and  engaging  
in  self-care  activities.  Mindfulness  practice  can  bring  
increased  peace  and  calm  into  her  life  and  quiet  the  
constant  chatter  in  her  mind.  I  want  to  give  Gwen  
some simple tools she can use and practice at home.
Therapist:
 Gwen, take a moment to sit quietly. Let 
your thoughts flow away and concentrate your 
attention on the present moment. How are you 
feeling? [She begins to notice bodily sensations] Gwen 
please bring your awareness to the top of your head 
and slowly begin to scan your entire body for any 
sensations of tension or tightness. What are you 
noticing?
Gwen: I am aware of tightness in my chest. It feels like 
a ball of stress.
Therapist: Focus all of your attention on the sensa-
tion in your chest. As you consciously tell yourself 
to relax, simply notice the sensations without judg-
ing them. How are you feeling?
Gwen: It’s a little strange, but I feel more at ease than 
when I first walked in the door.
Therapist: Do you think you can practice this mind-
fulness at home this week and focus on what you 
want to bring into your life?
Gwen: I do want to communicate better with my 
husband and be able to ask him for support. I feel 
much more relaxed here now, and I would like to 
try to feel that at home too. Calming myself and 
staying in the moment is a new experience for me.
Therapist: You have a good start on learning how 
mindfulness feels; let’s see how much progress you 
can make at home as you practice this week.
Gwen:
 OK, I feel less stressed when I slow down and 
try to relax in the moment. I am going to practice 
this every day during the week. [Goal-setting is an 
important part of behavior therapy]

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Behavior therapy is diverse with respect not only to basic concepts but also 
to techniques that can be applied in coping with specific problems with a wide range 
of  clients.  The  behavioral  movement  includes  four  major  areas  of  development:  
classical  conditioning,  operant  conditioning,  social-cognitive  theory,  and  increas-
ing attention to the cognitive factors influencing behavior (see Chapter 10). Third-
generation behavior therapies are recent developments in the field, and they include 
mindfulness  and  acceptance-based  behavior  therapies.  A  unique  characteristic  of  
all forms of behavior therapy is its strict reliance on the principles of the scientific 
method.  Concepts  and  procedures  are  stated  explicitly,  tested  empirically,  and  
revised continually. Treatment and assessment are interrelated and occur simulta-
neously. Research is considered to be a basic aspect of the approach, and therapeutic 
techniques are continually refined.
A  cornerstone  of  behavior  therapy  is  identifying  specific  goals  at  the  outset  of  
the  therapeutic  process.  In  helping  clients  achieve  their  goals,  behavior  therapists  
typically  assume  an  active  and  directive  role.  Although  the  client  generally  deter-
mines what  behavior  will  be  changed,  the  therapist  typically  determines  how  this  
behavior  can  best  be  modified.  In  designing  a  treatment  plan,  behavior  therapists  
employ techniques and procedures from a wide variety of therapeutic systems and 
apply them to the unique needs of each client.
Contemporary behavior therapy places emphasis on the interplay between the 
individual  and  the  environment.  Behavioral  strategies  can  be  used  to  attain  both  
individual  goals  and  societal  goals.  Because  cognitive  factors  have  a  place  in  the  
practice of behavior therapy, techniques from this approach can be used to attain 
humanistic  ends.  It  is  clear  that  bridges  can  connect  humanistic  and  behavioral  
therapies,  especially  with  the  current  focus  of  attention  on  self-management  and  
the  incorporation  of  mindfulness  and  acceptance-based  approaches  into  behav-
ioral  practice.  Mindfulness  practices  rely  on  experiential  learning  and  client  dis-
covery rather than on didactic instruction. Mindfulness is a way of being that takes 
ongoing effort to develop and refine (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). Self-compassion is a foun-
dational part of the new wave of behavior therapies and is linked to an increased 
I  encourage  Gwen  to  practice  paying  attention  to  
her  behaviors  and  to  consider  using  mindfulness  
practice  as  a  way  of  refocusing  on  what  she  wants  
to bring into her life. It is my hope that her mind-
fulness practice will lead to an overall reduction in 
stress and increased presence and connection in her

sense of well-being. These newer approaches represent a blend of Eastern practices 
and  Western  methodology.  Contemporary  behavior  therapy  has  broadened  from  
a narrow focus on dealing with simple problems to addressing complex aspects of 
personal functioning.
Contributions of Behavior Therapy
Behavior therapy challenges us to reconsider our global approach to counseling. Some 
may  assume  they  know  what  a  client  means  by  the  statement,  “I  feel  unloved;  life  
has no meaning.” A humanist might nod in acceptance to such a statement, but the 
behaviorist may respond with: “Who specifically do you feel is not loving you?” “What 
is going on in your life to make you think it has no meaning?” “What are some specific 
things you might be doing that contribute to the state you are in?” “What would you 
most like to change?” A key strength of behavior therapy is its precision in specifying 
goals, target behaviors, and procedures. The specificity of the behavioral approaches 
helps  clients  translate  unclear  goals  into  concrete  plans  of  action,  and  it  helps  both  
the  counselor  and  the  client  to  keep  these  plans  clearly  in  focus.  Ledley,  Marx,  and  
Heimberg (2010) state that therapists can help clients learn about the contingencies 
that  maintain  their  problematic  thoughts  and  behaviors  and  then  teach  them  ways  
to  make  the  changes  they  want.  Techniques  such  as  role  playing,  relaxation  proce-
dures,  behavioral  rehearsal,  coaching,  guided  practice,  modeling,  feedback,  learning  
by successive approximations, mindfulness skills, and homework assignments can be 
included in any therapist’s repertoire, regardless of theoretical orientation.
An advantage behavior therapists have is the wide variety of specific behavioral 
techniques  at  their  disposal.  Because  behavior  therapy  stresses  doing,  as  opposed  
to  merely  talking  about  problems  and  gathering  insights,  practitioners  use  many  
behavioral  strategies  to  assist  clients  in  formulating  a  plan  of  action  for  changing  
behavior. The basic therapeutic conditions stressed by person-centered therapists—
active listening, accurate empathy, positive regard, genuineness, respect, acceptance, 
and immediacy—need to be integrated in a behavioral framework.
A major contribution of behavior therapy is its emphasis on research into and 
assessment  of  treatment  outcomes.  It  is  up  to  practitioners  to  demonstrate  that  
therapy  is  working.  If  progress  is  not  being  made,  therapists  look  carefully  at  the  
original analysis and treatment plan. Of all the therapies presented in this book, this 
approach  and  its  techniques  have  been  subjected  to  the  most  empirical  research.  
Behavioral practitioners are put to the test of identifying specific interventions that 
have been demonstrated to be effective.
Evidence-based  therapies  (EBT)  are  a  hallmark  of  both  behavior  therapy  and  
cognitive behavior therapy. To their credit, behavior therapists are willing to exam-
ine the effectiveness of their procedures in terms of the generalizability, meaningful-
ness,  and  durability  of  change.  Most  studies  show  that  behavior  therapy  methods  
are more effective than no treatment. Moreover, a number of behavioral and cogni-
tive  behavioral  procedures  are  currently  the  best  treatment  strategies  available  for  
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, hypochon-
driasis, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders,

borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, and childhood disorders (Hollon 
& DiGiuseppe, 2011).
The new generation of mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies has shifted 
behavior therapy from treating simple and discrete problems to a more complex and 
complete  psychotherapy  that  is  based  in  behavioral  principles  (Prochaska  &  Nor-
cross, 2014). Prochaska and Norcross confidently predict an increase and expansion 
of the third-wave therapies in the next decade and state that these approaches will 
likely “become firmly established within the ever-expanding, evidence-based context 
of cognitive-behavioral therapy” (p. 314).
A strength of the behavioral approaches is the emphasis on ethical accountabil-
ity. Behavior therapy is ethically neutral in that it does not dictate whose behavior 
or what behavior should be changed. At least in cases of voluntary counseling, the 
behavioral  practitioner  only  specifies  how  to  change  those  behaviors  the  client  tar-
gets  for  change.  Clients  have  a  good  deal  of  control  and  freedom  in  deciding  what 
the goals of therapy will be. A collaborative therapist–client relationship is an essen-
tial aspect of behavior therapy. Because clients are active in selecting goals and pro-
cedures  in  the  therapy  process  and  are  applying  what  they  are  learning  in  therapy  
to  daily  life,  the  chance  that  they  will  become  the  target  of  unethical  behavior  is  
decreased (Speigler, 2016).
Limitations and Criticisms of Behavior Therapy
Behavior  therapy  has  been  criticized  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  Let’s  examine  four  
common criticisms and misconceptions people often have about behavior therapy, 
together with my reactions.
Behavior therapy may change behaviors, but it does not change feelings.    Some    
critics  argue  that  feelings  must  change  before  behavior  can  change.  Behavioral  
practitioners  hold  that  empirical  evidence  has  not  shown  that  feelings  must  be  
changed  first,  and  behavioral  clinicians  do  in  actual  practice  deal  with  feelings  as  
an overall part of the treatment process. A general criticism of both the behavioral 
and the cognitive approaches is that clients are not encouraged to experience their 
emotions. In concentrating on how clients are behaving or thinking, some behavior 
therapists tend to play down the working through of emotional issues. Generally, 
I  favor  initially  focusing  on  what  clients  are  feeling  and  then  working  with  the  
behavioral and cognitive dimensions. When clients’ feelings are engaged, this seems 
to me to be a good point of departure. I can still tie a discussion of what clients are 
feeling with how this is affecting their behavior, and I can later inquire about their 
cognitions.
Behavior  therapy  does  not  provide  insight.  If  this  assertion  is  indeed  true,  
behavior therapists would probably respond that insight is not a necessary requisite 
for behavior change. Follette and Callaghan (2011) state that contemporary behavior 
therapists tend to be leery of the role of insight in favor of alterable, controllable, 
causal variables. It is possible for therapy to proceed without a client knowing how 
change is taking place. Although change may be taking place, clients often cannot 
explain precisely why. Furthermore, insights may result after clients make a change

in behavior. Behavioral shifts often lead to a change in understanding or to insight, 
which may lead to emotional changes as well.
Behavior  therapy  treats  symptoms  rather  than  causes.  The  psychoanalytic  
assumption  is  that  early  traumatic  events  are  at  the  root  of  present  dysfunction.  
Behavior therapists may acknowledge that deviant responses have historical origins, 
but  they  contend  that  history  is  less  important  in  the  maintenance  of  current  
problems than environmental events such as antecedents and consequences. However, 
behavior  therapists  emphasize  changing  current  environmental  circumstances  to  
change behavior.
Related  to  this  criticism  is  the  notion  that  unless  historical  causes  of  present  
behavior  are  therapeutically  explored  new  symptoms  will  soon  take  the  place  of  
those  that  were  “cured.”  Behaviorists  rebut  this  assertion  on  both  theoretical  and  
empirical grounds. They contend that behavior therapy directly changes the main-
taining  conditions  of  problem  behaviors  (symptoms),  thereby  indirectly  changing  
the problem behaviors. Furthermore, they assert that there is no empirical evidence 
that  symptom  substitution  occurs  after  behavior  therapy  has  successfully  elimi-
nated unwanted behavior because they have changed the conditions that give rise to 
those behaviors (Spiegler, 2016).
Behavior  therapy  involves  control  and  social  influence  by  the  therapist.    All    
therapists  have  a  power  relationship  with  the  client  and  thus  therapy  involves  
social  influence;  the  ethical  issue  relates  to  the  therapist’s  degree  of  awareness  of  
this influence and how it is addressed in therapy. Behavior therapy recognizes the 
importance of making the social influence process explicit, and it emphasizes client-
oriented behavioral goals. Therapy progress is continually assessed and treatment is 
modified to ensure that the client’s goals are being met.
Behavior  therapists  address  ethical  issues  by  stating  that  therapy  is  basically  a  
psychoeducational process. At the outset of behavior therapy, clients learn about the 
nature  of  counseling,  the  procedures  that  may  be  employed,  and  the  benefits  and  
risks. Clients are given information about the specific therapy procedures appropri-
ate for their particular problems. To some extent, they also participate in the choice 
of techniques that will be used in dealing with their problems. With this informa-
tion clients become informed, genuine partners in the therapeutic venture.
The literature in the field of behavior therapy is so extensive and diverse that it is 
not possible in one brief survey chapter to present a comprehensive, in-depth discus-
sion of behavioral concepts and techniques. Examining some of the suggested read-
ings at the end of this chapter will further your knowledge of this complex approach.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions

270            CHAPTER TEN
Introduction
As  you  saw  in  Chapter  9,  traditional  behavior  therapy  has  broadened  and  
largely  moved  in  the  direction  of  cognitive  behavior  therapy.  Several  of  the  more  
prominent cognitive behavioral approaches are featured in this chapter, including 
Albert Ellis’s rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), Aaron T. Beck and Judith 
Beck’s cognitive therapy (CT), Christine Padesky’s strengths-based CBT (SB-CBT), 
and  Donald  Meichenbaum’s  cognitive  behavior  therapy.  These  approaches  all  fall  
under the general umbrella of cognitive behavior therapies (CBT).
All of the cognitive behavioral approaches share the same basic characteristics 
and  assumptions  as  traditional  behavior  therapy  (see  Chapter  9).  Although  the  
approaches are quite diverse, they do share these attributes: (1) a collaborative rela-
tionship  between  client  and  therapist,  (2)  the  premise  that  psychological  distress  
is  often  maintained  by  cognitive  processes,  (3)  a  focus  on  changing  cognitions  to  
produce desired changes in affect and behavior, (4) a present-centered, time-limited 
focus,  (5)  an  active  and  directive  stance  by  the  therapist,  and  (6)  an  educational  
treatment focusing on specific and structured target problems (A. Beck & Weishaar, 
2014).  In  addition,  both  cognitive  therapy  and  the  cognitive  behavioral  therapies  
are based on a structured psychoeducational model, make use of homework, place 
responsibility on the client to assume an active role both during and outside ther-
apy  sessions,  emphasize  developing  a  strong  therapeutic  alliance,  and  draw  from  
a  variety  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  strategies  to  bring  about  change.  Therapists  
help clients examine how they understand themselves and their world and suggest 
ways  clients  can  experiment  with  new  ways  of  behaving  (Dienes,  Torres-Harding,  
Reinecke, Freeman, & Sauer, 2011).
To a large degree, both cognitive therapy and cognitive behavior therapy are based 
on  the  assumption  that  beliefs,  behaviors,  emotions,  and  physical  reactions  are  all  
reciprocally linked. Changes in one area lead to changes in the other areas. A change 
in  beliefs  is  not  the  only  target  of  therapy,  but  enduring  changes  usually  require  a  
change in beliefs. CBT therapists apply behavioral techniques such as operant condi-
tioning, modeling, and behavioral rehearsal to the more subjective processes of think-
ing and internal dialogue. In addition, therapists help clients actively test their beliefs 
in therapy, on paper, and through behavioral experiments. Cognitive therapy and the 
cognitive behavioral approaches include a variety of behavioral strategies (discussed in 
Chapter 9) as well as cognitive strategies as a part of their integrative repertoire.

rational  emotive  behavior  therapy  (REBT)  was  the  first  of  the  cognitive  behav-
ior therapies, and today it continues to be a major cognitive behavioral approach. 
REBT  has  a  great  deal  in  common  with  the  therapies  that  are  oriented  toward

cognition and behavior as it also emphasizes thinking, assessing, deciding, analyz-
ing, and doing. A basic assumption of REBT is that people contribute to their own 
psychological  problems,  as  well  as  to  specific  symptoms,  by  the  rigid  and  extreme  
beliefs  they  hold  about  events  and  situations.  REBT  is  based  on  the  assumption  
that cognitions, emotions, and behaviors interact significantly and have a reciprocal 
cause-and-effect relationship. REBT has consistently emphasized all three of these 
modalities  and  their  interactions,  thus  qualifying  it  as  a  holistic  and  integrative  
approach (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011, 2014; D. Ellis, 2014).
Although  REBT  is  generally  conceded  to  be  the  parent  of  today’s  cognitive  
behavioral approaches, it was preceded by earlier schools of thought. Ellis gave credit 
to Alfred Adler as an influential precursor of REBT, and Karen Horney’s (1950) ideas 
on the “tyranny of the shoulds” are apparent in the conceptual framework of REBT. 
Ellis also acknowledged his debt to some of the Eastern philosophies and the ancient 
Greeks, especially the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who said around 2,000 years ago:  
ALBERT ELLIS (1913–2007) was born in 
Pittsburgh  but  escaped  to  the  wilds  of  
New York at the age of 4 and lived there 
(except for a year in New Jersey) for the 
rest of his life. He was hospitalized nine 
times  as  a  child,  mainly  with  nephritis,  
and  developed  renal  glycosuria  at  the  
age of 19 and diabetes at the age of 40. 
Despite  his  many  physical  challenges,  
he lived an unusually robust, active, and 
energetic  life  until  his  death  at  age  93.  
As  he  put  it,  “I  am  busy  spreading  the  
gospel according to St. Albert.”
Realizing that he could counsel people skillfully 
and that he greatly enjoyed doing so, Ellis decided to 
become a psychologist. Believing psychoanalysis to be 
the deepest form of psychotherapy, Ellis was analyzed 
and supervised by a training analyst. He then practiced 
psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy, but even-
tually he became disillusioned with the slow progress 
of  his  clients.  He  observed  that  they  improved  more  
quickly  once  they  changed  their  ways  of  thinking  
about  themselves  and  their  problems.  Early  in  1955  
he developed an approach to psychotherapy he called 
rational  therapy  and  later  rational  emotive  therapy,  
and which is now known as rational emotive behavior 
therapy  (REBT).  Ellis  has  rightly  been  referred  to  as  
the grandfather of cognitive behavior therapy.
To  some  extent  Ellis  developed  his  approach  as  
a  method  of  dealing  with  his  own  problems  during  
his youth. At one point in his life, for example, he had 
exaggerated  fears  of  speaking  in  public.  During  his  
adolescence  he  was  extremely  shy  around  
young  women.  At  age  19  he  forced  him-
self  to  talk  to  100  different  women  in  the  
Bronx  Botanical  Gardens  over  a  period  of  
one  month.  Although  he  never  managed  
to  get  a  date  from  these  brief  encounters,  
he does report that he desensitized himself 
to his fear of rejection by women. By apply-
ing  rational  and  behavioral  methods,  he  
managed to conquer some of his strongest 
emotional blocks (A. Ellis, 1994, 1997).
People  who  heard  Ellis  lecture  often  
commented  on  his  abrasive,  humorous,  
and  flamboyant  style.  In  his  workshops  it  seemed  
that  he  took  delight  in  giving  vent  to  his  eccentric  
side,  such  as  peppering  his  speech  with  four-letter  
words.  He  greatly  enjoyed  his  work  and  teaching  
REBT, which was his passion and primary commit-
ment  in  life.  He  gave  workshops  wherever  he  went  
in his travels and had proclaimed, “I wouldn’t go to 
the  Taj  Mahal  unless  they  asked  me  to  do  a  work-
shop there!”
Ellis  married  Australian  psychologist  Debbie  
Joffe  in  November  2004,  whom  he  has  called  “the  
greatest love of my life” (A. Ellis, 2008). They shared 
the  same  life  goals  and  ideals,  and  they  worked  as  
a team presenting workshops. If you are interested 
in learning more about the life and work of Albert 
Ellis,  I  recommend  two  of  his  books:  Rational  Emo-
tive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me—It Can Work for 
You  (A.  Ellis,  2004a)  and  All  Out!  An  Autobiography 
(A. Ellis, 2010).

“People  are  disturbed  not  by  events,  but  by  the  views  which  they  take  of  them”  
(as cited in A. Ellis, 2001a, p. 16). Ellis’s reformulation of Epictetus’s dictum can be 
stated as, “People disturb themselves as a result of the rigid and extreme beliefs they 
hold about events more than the events themselves.”
REBT’s  basic  hypothesis  is  that  our  emotions  are  mainly  created  from  our  
beliefs,  which  influence  the  evaluations  and  interpretations  we  make  and  fuel  
the  reactions  we  have  to  life  situations.  Through  the  therapeutic  process,  cli-
ents are taught skills that give them the tools to identify and dispute irrational 
beliefs that have been acquired and self-constructed and are now maintained by 
self-indoctrination. They learn how to replace such detrimental ways of think-
ing  with  effective  and  rational  cognitions,  and  as  a  result  they  change  their  
emotional experience and their reactions to situations. The therapeutic process 
allows clients to apply REBT principles for change not only to a particular pre-
senting problem but also to many other problems in life or future problems they 
might encounter.
A  large  part  of  the  therapy  is  seen  as  an  educational  process.  The  therapist  func-
tions in many ways like teacher, collaborating with the client on homework assign-
ments and introducing strategies for constructive thinking. The client is the learner 
who then practices these new skills in everyday life.
Key Concepts
View of Emotional Disturbance
REBT is based on the premise that we learn irrational beliefs from significant others 
during  childhood  and  then  re-create  these  irrational  beliefs  throughout  our  life-
time. We actively reinforce our self-defeating beliefs through the processes of auto-
suggestion and self-repetition, and we then behave in ways that are consistent with 
these beliefs. Hence, it is largely our own repetition of early-indoctrinated irrational 
beliefs,  rather  than  a  parent’s  repetition,  that  keeps  dysfunctional  attitudes  alive  
and operative within us.
Ellis asserted that blame can be at the core of many emotional disturbances. If 
we  want  to  become  psychologically  healthy,  we  had  better  stop  blaming  ourselves  
and  others  and  learn  to  fully  and  unconditionally  accept  ourselves  despite  our  
imperfections. Ellis (A. Ellis & Blau, 1998; A. Ellis & Harper, 1997; A. Ellis & Ellis, 
2011)  hypothesizes  that  we  have  strong  tendencies  to  transform  our  desires  and  
preferences into dogmatic “shoulds,” “musts,” “oughts,” demands, and commands. 
When  we  are  feeling  disturbed,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  look  to  our  hidden  dogmatic  
“musts” and absolutist “shoulds.” Such demands create disruptive feelings and dys-
functional behaviors (A. Ellis, 2001a, 2004a).
Here are three basics musts (or irrational beliefs) we internalize that inevitably lead 
to self-defeat (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011):
1.
 “I must do well and be loved and approved by others.”
2. “Other people must treat me fairly, kindly, and well.”
3. “The world and my living conditions must be comfortable, gratifying, 
and just, providing me with all that I want in life.”

We  have  a  strong  tendency  to  make  and  keep  ourselves  emotionally  disturbed  by  
internalizing  and  perpetuating  self-defeating  beliefs  such  as  these,  which  is  one  
reason  it  is  a  real  challenge  to  achieve  and  maintain  good  psychological  health   
(A. Ellis, 2001a, 2001b).
A-B-C Framework
The  A-B-C  framework  is  central  to  REBT  theory  and  practice.  This  model  
provides  a  useful  tool  for  understanding  the  client’s  feelings,  thoughts,  events,  and  
behavior (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011). A is the existence of an activating event or adversity, or 
an inference about an event by an individual. C is the emotional and behavioral conse-
quence or reaction of the individual; the reaction can be either healthy or unhealthy. A 
(the activating event) does not cause C (the emotional consequence). Instead, B, which 
is the person’s belief about A, largely creates C, the emotional reaction.
If  a  person  experiences  depression  after  a  divorce,  for  example,  it  may  not  be  
the  divorce  itself  that  causes  the  depressive  reaction,  nor  his  inference  that  he  has  
failed, but the person’s beliefs about his divorce or about his failure (D. Ellis, 2014). 
Ellis maintains that the beliefs about the rejection and failure (at point B) are what 
mainly cause the depression (at point C)—not the actual event of the divorce or the 
person’s  inference  of  failure  (at  point  A).  Believing  that  human  beings  are  largely  
responsible for creating their own emotional reactions and disturbances, and show-
ing  people  how  they  can  change  their  irrational  beliefs  that  directly  “cause”  their  
disturbed emotional consequences, is at the heart of REBT (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011; A. 
Ellis & Harper, 1997).
After A, B, and C comes D (disputing). Essentially, D encompasses methods that 
help clients challenge their irrational beliefs. There are three components of this dis-
puting process: detecting, debating, and discriminating. Clients learn to discriminate 
irrational (self-defeating) beliefs from rational (self-helping) beliefs (A. Ellis & Ellis, 
2011). Once they can detect irrational beliefs, particularly absolutistic “shoulds” and 
“musts,”  “awfulizing,”  and  “self-downing,”  clients  debate  dysfunctional  beliefs  by  
logically, empirically, and pragmatically questioning them. Clients are asked to vig-
orously argue themselves out of believing and acting on irrational beliefs. Although 
REBT uses many other cognitive, emotive, and behavioral methods to help clients 
minimize their irrational beliefs, it emphasizes the process of vigorously disputing 
(D)  such  beliefs  both  during  therapy  sessions  and  in  everyday  life.  Following  that,  
clients  are  encouraged  to  develop  E,  a  new  effective  philosophy,  which  also  has  a  
practical side. A new and effective belief system consists of replacing unhealthy irra-
tional thoughts with healthy rational ones. “Homework” can enhance and maintain 
these therapeutic gains and personal insights.
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
The many roads taken in rational emotive behavior therapy lead toward the destina-
tion  of  clients  minimizing  their  emotional  disturbances  and  self-defeating  behav-
iors by acquiring a more realistic, workable, and compassionate philosophy of life.

274            CHAPTER TEN
The therapeutic process of REBT involves a collaborative effort between therapist 
and client to choose realistic and life-enhancing therapeutic goals. The therapist’s 
task is to help clients differentiate between realistic and unrealistic goals and also 
between self-defeating and life-enhancing goals. A basic aim is to teach clients how 
to change their dysfunctional emotions and behaviors into healthy ones. According 
to Ellis and Ellis (2011) another goal of REBT is to assist clients in the process of 
achieving unconditional self-acceptance (USA), unconditional other-acceptance (UOA), and 
unconditional life-acceptance (ULA). As clients become more able to accept themselves, 
they  are  more  likely  to  unconditionally  accept  others  and  to  accept  life  as  it  is.  A  
famous saying of Ellis (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011) is: “Life has inevitable suffering as well 
as pleasure. By realistically thinking, feeling, and acting to enjoy what you can, and 
unangrily and unwhiningly accepting painful aspects that cannot be changed, you 
open yourself to much joy” (p. 48).
Therapist’s Function and Role
The therapist has specific tasks, and the first step is to show clients how they have 
incorporated many irrational absolute “shoulds,” “oughts,” and “musts” into their 
thinking. The therapist disputes clients’ irrational beliefs and encourages clients to 
engage  in  activities  that  will  counter  their  self-defeating  beliefs  by  replacing  their  
rigid “musts” with preferences.
A second step in the therapeutic process is to demonstrate how clients are keep-
ing their emotional disturbances active by continuing to think illogically and unre-
alistically. In other words, when clients keep reindoctrinating themselves, they create 
their own psychological problems. Ellis reminds us that we are responsible for our 
own emotional destiny (A. Ellis, 2004b, 2010).
To  get  beyond  mere  recognition  of  irrational  thoughts,  the  therapist  takes  a  
third step—helping clients change their thinking and minimize their irrational ideas. 
Although it may be unlikely that we can entirely eliminate the tendency to think irra-
tionally, we can make ongoing efforts to reduce the frequency of such thinking. The 
therapist  encourages  clients  to  identify  the  irrational  beliefs  they  have  unquestion-
ingly  accepted,  demonstrates  how  they  are  continuing  to  indoctrinate  themselves  
with these beliefs, and reminds them that change is possible with persistent effort.
The  fourth  step  in  the  therapeutic  process  is  to  strongly  encourage  clients  to  
develop  a  rational  philosophy  of  life  so  that  in  the  future  they  can  avoid  hurting  
themselves  again  by  believing  other  irrational  beliefs.  Tackling  only  specific  prob-
lems or symptoms can give no assurance that new disabling fears will not emerge. 
It is desirable, then, for the therapist to dispute the core irrational thinking and to 
teach clients how to substitute rational beliefs and healthy behaviors for irrational 
beliefs and self-defeating behaviors.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
The therapeutic process largely focuses on clients’ experiences in the present. Like 
the person-centered and existential approaches to therapy, REBT emphasizes here-
and-now  experiences  and  clients’  present  ability  to  change  the  patterns  of  think-
ing and emoting that they constructed earlier. The therapist may not devote much 
time to exploring clients’ early history and making connections between their past

and present behavior unless doing so will aid the therapeutic process. REBT differs 
from  many  other  therapeutic  approaches  in  that  it  does  not  place  much  value  on  
free  association,  working  with  dreams,  or  dealing  with  transference  phenomena.  
Ellis  and  Ellis  (2014)  maintain  that  transference  is  not  encouraged,  and  when  it  
does occur, the therapist is likely to confront it because it is generally based on the 
client’s dire need to be liked and approved of by the therapist. Any unhealthy needi-
ness  clients  display  can  be  counterproductive  and  foster  dependence  on  approval  
from the therapist.
Clients are encouraged to actively work outside therapy sessions. By carrying out 
behavioral  homework  assignments,  clients  become  increasingly  proficient  at  mini-
mizing  irrational  thinking  and  disturbances  in  feeling  and  behaving.  Homework 
is  carefully  designed  and  agreed  upon  and  is  aimed  at  getting  clients  to  carry  out  
productive  actions  that  contribute  to  emotional  and  attitudinal  change.  These  
assignments are checked in later sessions, and clients continue to focus on learning 
effective ways to dispute self-defeating thinking. Toward the end of therapy, clients 
review  their  progress,  make  plans,  and  identify  strategies  to  prevent,  or  cope  with,  
any new challenges as they arise.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Because  REBT  is  a  cognitive  and  directive  behavioral  process,  a  warm  relation-
ship between therapist and client is not required, but it may enhance the process 
for some. At the very least, a respectful relationship is recommended. As with the 
person-centered therapy of Rogers, REBT practitioners strive to unconditionally 
accept all clients and to teach them to unconditionally accept others and them-
selves.  The  therapist  takes  the  mystery  out  of  the  therapeutic  process,  teaching  
clients about the cognitive hypothesis of disturbance and helping clients under-
stand  how  they  are  continuing  to  sabotage  themselves  and  what  they  can  do  to  
change. Insight alone does not typically lead to psychotherapeutic change, action 
is also required. The therapist frequently acknowledges any progress clients have 
made due to their own efforts. REBT practitioners accept their clients (and them-
selves!)  as  imperfect  beings  who  can  be  helped  through  a  variety  of  techniques  
including  teaching,  bibliotherapy,  and  behavior  modification  (A.  Ellis  &  Ellis,  
2011, 2014; D. Ellis, 2014).
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy
Rational  emotive  behavior  therapists  are  multimodal  and  integrative.  REBT  prac-
titioners use a number of different modalities (cognitive, emotive, behavioral, and 
interpersonal) to dispel self-defeating cognitions and to teach people how to acquire 
a rational approach to living. Therapists are encouraged to be flexible and creative 
in their use of methods, making sure to tailor the techniques to the unique needs of 
each client (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011; D. Ellis, 2014).

and  Psychotherapy  (Corey,  2013,  chap.  8).  What  follows  is  a  brief  summary  of  the  
major cognitive, emotive, and behavioral techniques Ellis describes (A. Ellis, 2004a; 
A. Ellis & Crawford, 2000; A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011).
Cognitive  Methods  REBT  practitioners  usually  incorporate  a  persuasive  
cognitive methodology in the therapeutic process. They demonstrate to clients, often 
in a quick and direct manner, what it is that they are continuing to tell themselves. 
Then they teach clients how to challenge these self-statements so that they no longer 
believe them, encouraging them to acquire a philosophy based on facts. REBT relies 
heavily on thinking, disputing, debating, challenging, interpreting, explaining, and 
teaching.  The  most  efficient  way  to  bring  about  lasting  emotional  and  behavioral  
change is for clients to change their way of thinking (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011, 2014).
Here are some cognitive techniques available to the therapist.
Disputing irrational beliefs. The most common cognitive method of REBT 
consists of the therapist actively disputing clients’ irrational beliefs and 
teaching them how to do this challenging on their own. Clients dispute 
a particular “must,” absolute “should,” or “ought” until they no longer 
hold that irrational belief, or at least until it is diminished in strength. 
Here are some examples of questions or statements clients learn to tell 
themselves when they dispute their irrational ideas: “Why must people 
treat me fairly?” “How do I become a total flop if I don’t succeed at 
important tasks I try?” “If I don’t get the job I want, it may be disap-
pointing, but I can certainly stand it.” “If life doesn’t always go the way 
I would like it to, it isn’t awful, just inconvenient.”
Doing cognitive homework. REBT clients are expected to make lists of their 
problems, look for their absolutist beliefs, and dispute these beliefs. 
Clients are encouraged to record and think about how their beliefs 
contribute to their personal problems and are asked to work hard at 
uprooting these self-defeating cognitions. Homework assignments are a 
way of tracking down and attending to the “shoulds” and “musts” that 
are part of their internalized self-messages. In this way, clients gradu-
ally learn to lessen anxiety and to challenge basic irrational thinking. 
They often fill out the REBT Self-Help Form, which is reproduced in 
the Student Manual for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy 
(Corey, 2017). Their comments on this form can focus therapy sessions 
as they critically evaluate the disputation of their beliefs. Clients may be 
encouraged to put themselves in risk-taking situations that will allow 
them to challenge self-limiting beliefs. For example, a client with a tal-
ent for acting who is afraid to act in front of an audience because of fear 
of failure may be asked to take a small part in a stage play. Work in the 
therapy session can be designed so that out-of-session tasks are feasible 
and the client has the skills to complete these tasks. Making changes 
tends to be hard work. Doing work outside sessions is of real value in 
revising clients’ thinking, feeling, and behaving.
Bibliotherapy. REBT, and other CBT approaches, can utilize biblio-
therapy as an adjunctive form of treatment. There are advantages of

tic approaches have empirical support for a range of clinical problems, 
including the treatment of depression and many anxiety disorders 
(Jacobs, 2008). Because therapy is seen as an educational process, clients 
are encouraged to read REBT self-help books such as Rational Emotive 
Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me—It Can Work for You (A. Ellis, 2004a) and 
other books by Ellis (1999, 2000, 2001a, 2001b, 2005, 2010; A. Ellis & 
Ellis, 2011).
Changing one’s language. REBT rests on the premise that imprecise lan-
guage is one of the causes of distorted thinking processes. Clients 
learn that “musts,” “oughts,” and absolute “shoulds” can be replaced 
by preferences. Instead of saying “It would be absolutely awful if ...” they 
learn to say “It would be inconvenient if ...” Clients who use language 
patterns that reflect helplessness and self-condemnation can learn to 
employ new self-statements, which help them think and behave differ-
ently. As a consequence, they also begin to feel differently.
Psychoeducational methods. REBT programs introduce clients to various edu-
cational materials such as books, DVDs, and articles. Therapists educate 
clients about the nature of their problems and how treatment is likely to 
proceed. They ask clients how particular concepts apply to them. Clients 
are more likely to cooperate with a treatment program if they understand 
how the therapy process works and if they understand why particular 
techniques are being used (Ledley, Marx, & Heimberg, 2010).
Emotive  Techniques  REBT  practitioners  use  a  variety  of  emotive  procedures,  
including   unconditional   acceptance,   rational   emotive   role   playing,   modeling,   
rational emotive imagery, and shame-attacking exercises. These emotive techniques 
tend  to  be  vivid  and  evocative  in  nature,  and  their  purpose  is  to  dispute  clients’  
irrational  beliefs.  These  strategies  are  used  both  during  the  therapy  sessions  and  
as  homework  assignments  in  daily  life.  Their  purpose  is  not  simply  to  provide  a  
cathartic  experience  but  to  help  clients  change  some  of  their  thoughts,  emotions,  
and  behaviors  (A.  Ellis,  2001b;  A.  Ellis  &  Ellis,  2011).  Let’s  look  at  some  of  these  
evocative and emotive therapeutic techniques in more detail.
Rational emotive imagery. This is a form of intense mental practice 
designed to establish new emotional patterns in place of disrup-
tive ones by thinking in healthy ways (see A. Ellis, 2001a, 2001b). 
In rational emotive imagery (rei), clients are asked to vividly 
imagine one of the worst things that might happen to them and to 
describe their disturbing feelings. Clients are shown how to train 
themselves to develop healthy emotions, and as their feelings about 
adversities change, they stand a better chance of changing their 
behavior in the situation. This technique can be usefully applied to 
interpersonal and other situations that are problematic for the indi-
vidual. Clients who practice rational emotive imagery several times 
a week for a few weeks may reach the point where they no longer

feel upset over these negative events (A. Ellis, 2001a; A. Ellis & Ellis, 
2011; D. Ellis, 2014).
Humor. Ellis contends that emotional disturbances often result from 
taking oneself too seriously. He wrote hundreds of “Rational Humor-
ous Songs” (A. Ellis, 2005) and often led attendees at his workshops 
in singing them. One appealing aspect of REBT is that it fosters the 
development of a better sense of humor and helps put life into healthy 
perspective (A. Ellis 2004a, 2010). Humor has both cognitive and 
emotional benefits in bringing about change. Humor shows the absur-
dity of certain ideas that clients steadfastly maintain, and it teaches 
clients to laugh—not at themselves but at their self-defeating ways of 
thinking.
Role playing. Role playing has emotive, cognitive, and behavioral com-
ponents. The therapist may interrupt to show clients what they are 
telling themselves to create their disturbances and what they can do to 
change unhealthy feelings to healthy ones. Clients can rehearse certain 
roles to bring out what they feel in a situation. For example, Dawson 
may put off applying to a graduate school because he is afraid he won’t 
be accepted. Just the thought of not being accepted to the school of 
his choice brings out intense feelings of shame for “being stupid.” The 
focus is on working through underlying irrational beliefs related to his 
unpleasant feelings. Dawson role-plays an interview with the dean of 
graduate students, notes his anxiety and the specific beliefs leading to 
it, and challenges his conviction that he absolutely must be accepted 
and that not gaining such acceptance means that he is a stupid and 
incompetent person.
Shame-attacking exercises. Ellis developed exercises to help people reduce 
shame and anxiety over behaving in certain ways. He asserts that we 
can stubbornly refuse to feel ashamed by telling ourselves that it is 
not catastrophic if someone thinks we are foolish. Practicing shame-
attacking exercises can reduce, minimize, and prevent feelings of 
shame, guilt, anxiety, and depression (A. Ellis, 1999, 2000, 2001a, 
2001b, 2005, 2010; A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011, 2014). The exercises are aimed 
at increasing self-acceptance and mature responsibility, as well as 
helping clients see that much of what they think of as being shameful 
has to do with the way they define reality for themselves. Clients may 
take the risk of doing something that they are ordinarily afraid to do 
because of what others might think. Through homework practice, cli-
ents eventually learn that they can choose not to let others’ reactions 
or possible disapproval stop them from doing the things they would 
like to do. For example, clients may wear “loud” clothes designed to 
attract attention, sing loudly, ask a silly question at a lecture, or ask 
for a left-handed monkey wrench in a grocery store. By carrying out 
such assignments, clients are likely to find out that other people are 
not really that interested in their behavior. Note that these exercises do 
not involve illegal activities or acts that will be harmful to oneself, to 
others, or that will unduly alarm other people!

AARON  TEMKIN  BECK  (b.  1921)  was  
born  in  Providence,  Rhode  Island.  His  
childhood,  although  happy,  was  inter-
rupted by a life-threatening illness when 
he  was  8  years  old.  As  a  consequence,  
he  experienced  blood  injury  fears,  fear  
of  suffocation,  and  anxiety  about  his  
health. Beck used his personal problems 
as a basis for understanding others and 
for developing his cognitive theory.
A  graduate  of  Brown  University  and  
Yale School of Medicine, Beck initially was 
trained  as  a  neurologist,  but  he  switched  
to  psychiatry  during  his  residency.  Beck  attempted  to  
validate  Freud’s  theory  of  depression,  but  the  results  of  
his research did not support Freud’s motivational model 
and  the  explanation  of  depression  as  “anger  turned  
inward.”  Beck  set  out  to  develop  a  model  for  depression  
that  fit  with  his  empirical  findings,  and  for  many  years  
Beck  endured  isolation  from  and  rejection  by  most  of  
his  colleagues  in  the  psychiatric  community.  Through  
his research, Beck developed a cognitive theory of depres-
sion,  which  represented  a  new  and  comprehensive  con-
ceptualization.  He  found  the  cognitions  of  depressed  
individuals were characterized by errors in interpretation 
that  he  called  “cognitive  distortions.”  For  Beck,  negative  
thoughts  reflect  underlying  dysfunctional  beliefs  and  
assumptions.  When  these  beliefs  are  triggered  by  situ-
ational events, a depressive pattern is put in motion. Beck 
believes  clients  can  assume  an  active  role  in  modifying  
their dysfunctional thinking and thereby gain relief from 
a range of psychiatric conditions. His continuous research 
in the areas of psychopathology and the utility of cogni-
tive therapy eventually earned him a place of prominence 
in  the  scientific  community  in  the  United  States.  Beck  
is  the  founder  of  cognitive  therapy  (CT),  
one of the most influential and empirically 
validated approaches to psychotherapy. He 
has  won  nearly  every  national  and  interna-
tional  prize  for  his  scientific  contributions  
to  psychotherapy  and  suicide  research  and  
was even short-listed for the Nobel Prize in 
medicine.
Beck  joined  the  Department  of  Psy-
chiatry  of  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  
in 1954, where he currently holds the posi-
tion of University Professor (Emeritus) of 
Psychiatry.  Beck  has  successfully  applied  
cognitive  therapy  to  depression,  generalized  anxiety  
and  panic  disorders,  suicide,  alcoholism  and  drug  
abuse, eating disorders, marital and relationship prob-
lems,  psychotic  disorders,  and  personality  disorders.   
He  has  developed  assessment  scales  for  depression,  
suicide risk, anxiety, self-concept, and personality.
He is the founder of the Beck Institute, which is 
a  research  and  training  center  directed  by  one  of  his  
four  children,  Dr.  Judith  Beck.  He  has  nine  grand-
children  and  five  great-grandchildren  and  has  been  
married for more than 60 years. To his credit, Aaron 
Beck has focused on developing the cognitive therapy 
skills  of  tens  of  thousands  of  clinicians  throughout  
the  world.  In  turn,  many  of  them  have  established  
their own cognitive therapy centers. Beck has a vision 
for  the  cognitive  therapy  community  that  is  global,  
inclusive, collaborative, empowering, and benevolent. 
He continues to remain active in writing and research 
and has published 24 books and more than 600 arti-
cles and book chapters. For more on the life of Aaron 
T. Beck, see Aaron T. Beck (Weishaar, 1993) or “Aaron 
T. Beck: Mind, Man and Mentor” (Padesky, 2004).

JUDITH  S.  BECK  (b.  1954)  was  born  
in   Philadelphia,   the   second   of   four   
children.  Both  her  parents  were  quite  
notable  in  their  fields:  her  father,  as  
“the  father  of  cognitive  therapy,”  and  
her  mother,  as  the  first  female  judge  
on the appellate court of the Common-
wealth  of  Pennsylvania.  From  an  early  
age, Beck wanted to be an educator, and 
she began her professional career teach-
ing  children  with  learning  disabilities.  
Her ability to break down complex sub-
jects into easily understandable ideas, so 
critical in the education of children with 
learning  differences,  is  characteristic  of  
all her work.
Beck   later   returned   to   graduate   
school,  studied  education  and  psychol-
ogy,  and  completed  a  postdoctoral  fel-
lowship   at   the   Center   for   Cognitive   
Behavior  Therapy  at  the  University  of  
Pennsylvania. In 1994 she and her father

Aaron Beck’s Cognitive Therapy
Introduction
Aaron T. Beck developed cognitive therapy (CT) about the same time that 
Ellis was developing REBT. They were not aware of each others’ work and created 
their  approaches  independently.  Ellis  developed  REBT  based  on  philosophical  
tenets, whereas Beck’s CT was based on empirical research (Padesky & Beck, 2003). 
Like REBT, CT emphasizes education and prevention but uses specific methods tai-
lored to particular issues. The specificity of CT allows therapists to link assessment, 
conceptualization, and treatment strategies.
Beck (A. Beck 1963, 1967) set out to create an evidence-based therapy for depres-
sion, and he tested each of his theoretical constructs with empirical studies and con-
ducted controlled outcome studies to determine how CT’s outcomes compared with 
existing  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy  treatments  for  depression.  Beck’s  
careful empirical approach was eventually adopted by colleagues around the world. 
Evidence-supported  CT  approaches  were  developed  for  many  disorders  including  
depression,  panic  disorder,  social  anxiety,  phobias,  posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  
schizophrenia  and  other  psychotic  disorders,  hypochondriasis,  body  dysmorphic  
disorder, eating disorders, insomnia, anger issues, stress, chronic pain and fatigue, 
and  distress  due  to  general  medical  problems  such  as  cancer  (Hofmann,  Asnaani,  
Vonk, Sawyer, & Fang, 2012; White & Freeman, 2000).
Beck’s original depression research revealed that depressed clients had a nega-
tive bias in their interpretation of certain life events, which resulted from active pro-
cesses of cognitive distortion (A. Beck, 1967). This led Beck to believe that a therapy 
that helped depressed clients become aware of and change their negative thinking 
could be helpful. Unlike Ellis, Beck did not assert that negative thoughts were the 
sole cause of depression. Beck’s research indicated that depression could result from

opened  the  nonprofit  Beck  Institute  for  Cognitive  
Therapy  in  suburban  Philadelphia,  and  she  is  cur-
rently  president  of  the  institute.  A  premier  training  
organization, the institute is devoted to national and 
international  training  in  cognitive  therapy  through  
workshop and supervision programs for students and 
faculty, deployed and returning military families, and 
health and mental health professionals at all levels.
Beck   travels   extensively   in   the   United   States   
and  abroad,  teaching  and  disseminating  cognitive  
behavior therapy and assisting a wide variety of orga-
nizations  in  developing  or  strengthening  their  CT  
programs. She writes a number of CT-oriented blogs 
and edits “Cognitive Therapy Today,” an e-newsletter. 
She  is  coauthor  of  the  widely  adopted  self-report  
scales,   the   Personality   Belief   Questionnaire   and   the   
Beck  Youth  Inventories  II,  which  screens  children  aged  
7–18 for symptoms of depression, anxiety, disruptive 
behavior, self-concept, and anger.
Beck  is  Clinical  Associate  Professor  at  the  Uni-
versity   of   Pennsylvania   and   was   instrumental   in   
founding  the  Academy  of  Cognitive  Therapy,  the  
“home” organization for cognitive therapists world-
wide.  She  has  written  nearly  a  hundred  articles  and  
chapters on a variety of CT topics and authored sev-
eral  books  on  cognitive  therapy,  including  Cognitive 
Behavior  Therapy:  Basics  and  Beyond  (2011a),  Cognitive 
Therapy  for  Challenging  Problems:  What  to  Do  When  the  
Basics  Don’t  Work  (2005),  and  the  Cognitive  Therapy  
Worksheet Packet (2011b), as well as trade books with 
a  cognitive  behavioral  program  for  diet  and  main-
tenance.  Judith  Beck  has  been  married  for  34  years  
and has three adult children, one of whom is a social 
worker specializing in CT.

negative  thinking,  but  it  could  also  be  precipitated  by  genetic,  neurobiological,  or  
environmental  changes.  One  of  Beck’s  early  contributions  was  to  recognize  that  
regardless of the cause of depression, once people became depressed, their thinking 
reflected  what  Beck  referred  to  as  the  negative  cognitive  triad:  negative  views  of  
the  self  (self-criticism),the  world  (pessimism),  and  the  future  (hopelessness).  Beck  
believed  this  negative  cognitive  triad  maintained  depression,  even  when  negative  
thoughts  were  not  the  original  cause  of  an  episode  of  depression  (A.  Beck  1967;  
A. Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).
Cognitive  therapy  (CT)  has  a  number  of  similarities  to  both  rational  emotive  
behavior therapy and behavior therapy. All of these therapies are active, directive, time-
limited, present-centered, problem-oriented, collaborative, structured, and empirical. 
They include homework assignments and require clients to explicitly identify prob-
lems and the situations in which they occur (A. Beck & Weishaar, 2014). Similar to 
REBT and unlike behavior therapy, CT is based on the theoretical rationale that the 
way people feel and behave is influenced by how they perceive and place meaning on 
their experience. Three theoretical assumptions of CT are (1) that people’s thought 
processes are accessible to introspection, (2) that people’s beliefs have highly personal 
meanings,  and  (3)  that  people  can  discover  these  meanings  themselves  rather  than  
being taught or having them interpreted by the therapist (Weishaar, 1993).
From the beginning Beck developed specific treatment protocols for each prob-
lem whereas Ellis might teach similar philosophical principles to people with anxi-
ety, depression, or anger. Despite these differences, therapists who practice behavior 
therapy,  REBT,  and  CT  learn  from  each  other,  and  considerable  overlap  exists  in  
methods used by all three schools of therapy in contemporary clinical practice. The 
highest  standard  of  practice  today  is  to  offer  the  best  “evidence-based  practice”  
regardless of its origins, so a therapist might use behavioral methods to treat phobias 
and  cognitive  methods  to  treat  panic  disorder  because  research  has  demonstrated  
these methods to be most effective in treating these problems. Many therapists refer 
to  themselves  as  offering  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  regardless  of  whether  their  
original training was primarily in behavior therapy, REBT, or CT.
A Generic Cognitive Model
Reflecting on 50 years of research and the various applications of cognitive therapy, 
Beck  has  proposed  a  generic  cognitive  model  to  describe  principles  that  pertain  
to  all  CT  applications  from  depression  and  anxiety  treatments  to  therapies  for  a  
wide  variety  of  other  problems  including  psychosis  and  substance  use  (A.  Beck  &  
Haigh, 2014). By linking psychological difficulties with adaptive human responses, 
Beck believes the generic cognitive model “has the potential to be the only empiri-
cally supported general theory of psychopathology” (A. Beck & Haigh, 2014, p. 21). 
The generic cognitive model provides a comprehensive framework for understand-
ing psychological distress, and some of its major principles are described here. Beck 
encouraged others to design research to investigate the components of his model in 
an  effort  to  reach  the  best  understanding  possible  of  human  cognition,  behavior,  
and emotion. Let’s look at some of the principles on which this model is based.
Psychological distress can be thought of as an exaggeration of normal adaptive human func-
tioning. When people are functioning well, they experience many different emotions

in response to life events and behave in ways that help them solve problems, achieve 
goals, and protect themselves from harm. It is normal to sometimes withdraw from 
relationships,  avoid  situations  we  don’t  feel  prepared  to  handle,  or  worry  about  
problems  in  the  search  of  a  solution.  A  psychological  disorder  begins  when  these  
normal emotions and behaviors become disproportionate to life events in degree or 
frequency. For example, when a person begins to worry most of the time, even about 
situations that most people take in stride, that person is showing signs of general-
ized anxiety disorder.
Faulty information processing is a prime cause of exaggerations in adaptive emotional and 
behavioral  reactions.  Our  thinking  is  directly  connected  to  our  emotional  reactions,  
behaviors, and motivations. When we think about things in erroneous or distorted 
ways, we experience exaggerated or distorted emotional and behavioral reactions as 
well. Beck identifies several common cognitive distortions:
Arbitrary inferences are conclusions drawn without supporting evidence. 
This includes “catastrophizing,” or thinking of the absolute worst sce-
nario and outcomes for most situations. You might begin your first job as 
a counselor with the conviction that you will not be liked or valued. You 
are convinced that you fooled your professors and somehow just managed 
to get your degree, but now people will certainly see through you!
Selective abstraction consists of forming conclusions based on an isolated 
detail of an event while ignoring other information. The significance 
of the total context is missed. As a counselor, you might measure your 
worth by your errors and weaknesses rather than by your successes.
Overgeneralization is a process of holding extreme beliefs on the basis 
of a single incident and applying them inappropriately to dissimilar 
events or settings. If you have difficulty working with one adolescent, 
for example, you might conclude that you will not be effective counsel-
ing any adolescents. You might also conclude that you will not be effec-
tive working with any clients!
Magnification and minimization consist of perceiving a case or situation 
in a greater or lesser light than it truly deserves. You might make this 
cognitive error by assuming that even minor mistakes in counseling a 
client could easily create a crisis for the individual and might result in 
psychological damage.
Personalization is a tendency for individuals to relate external events to 
themselves, even when there is no basis for making this connection. If 
a client does not return for a second counseling session, you might be 
absolutely convinced that this absence is due to your terrible perfor-
mance during the initial session. You might tell yourself, “This situ-
ation proves that I really let that client down, and now she may never 
seek help again.”
Labeling and mislabeling involve portraying one’s identity on the basis  
of imperfections and mistakes made in the past and allowing them  
to define one’s true identity. If you are not able to live up to all of a  
client’s expectations, you might say to yourself, “I’m totally worthless 
and should turn my professional license in right away.”

Dichotomous thinking involves categorizing experiences in either-or extremes. 
With such polarized thinking, you might view yourself as either being 
the perfectly competent counselor (you always succeed with all clients) 
or as a total flop if you are not fully competent (there is no room for any 
mistakes).
Our beliefs play a major role in determining what type of psychological distress we will expe-
rience.  Each  emotional  and  behavioral  disorder  is  accompanied  by  beliefs  specific  to  
that  problem.  Consider  two  students  who  apply  to  college  and  are  not  accepted  to  
their first choice of school. One of the students becomes depressed, the other becomes 
anxious. Depression is accompanied by negative thoughts about oneself (“I’ve failed,” 
“Nothing will work out for me,” “I’ll never get into medical school”). Anxious thoughts 
reflect overestimations of threat or danger (“Everyone will think less of me when they 
find out I wasn’t admitted to that college”) and underestimations of one’s coping (“I 
won’t know what to say to people about it”) and underestimation of resources (“These 
other colleges won’t prepare me well enough for medical school”).
Central to cognitive therapy is the empirically supported observation that “changes in beliefs 
lead to changes in behaviors and emotions” (A. Beck & Haigh, 2014, p.14). If the students 
in the previous example can change the way they think about not being accepted to 
their first choice school, their depression and anxiety are likely to be lessened. The 
first student will undoubtedly feel less depressed once a more balanced view of the 
rejection  letter  is  adopted  (“More  good  students  apply  than  can  be  admitted.  My  
rejection  does  not  mean  I  failed.  I’m  sure  many  students  from  my  second  choice  
school go on to attend medical school.”). Similarly, the anxious student would ben-
efit from new beliefs as well (“I can tell others that I am disappointed that I did not 
get into my first choice college. Some people might think less of me, but those who 
really  care  about  me  will  understand  that  not  everyone  gets  their  first  choice  and  
they will be supportive.”).
If beliefs are not modified, clinical conditions are likely to reoccur. Even without counsel-
ing or a change in beliefs, people often recover from feelings of depression or anxiety 
and return to their usual healthy functioning. However, these feelings may return in 
times of future stress or disappointment if their basic beliefs have not changed. In 
studies of the long-term effects of treatments for depression and anxiety disorders, 
cognitive therapy and other types of CBT therapies have the lowest rates of relapse 
(Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006). Many believe this is because these therapies lead 
to enduring changes in beliefs.
Basic Principles of Cognitive Therapy
Cognitive therapy (CT) perceives psychological problems as an exaggeration 
of adaptive responses resulting from commonplace cognitive distortions. Like REBT, 
CT is an insight-focused therapy with a strong psychoeducational component that 
emphasizes recognizing and changing unrealistic thoughts and maladaptive beliefs. 
Cognitive  therapy  is  highly  collaborative  and  involves  designing  specific  learning  
experiences to help clients understand the links between their thoughts, behaviors, 
emotions,  physical  responses,  and  situations  (Greenberger  &  Padesky,  2016).  The  
goal of CT is to help clients learn practical skills that they can use to make changes in 
their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and how to sustain these changes over time.

In cognitive therapy, clients learn how to identify their dysfunctional thinking. 
Once  clients  identify  cognitive  distortions,  they  are  taught  to  examine  and  weigh  
the  evidence  for  and  against  them.  This  process  of  critically  examining  thoughts  
involves  empirically  testing  them  by  looking  for  evidence,  actively  engaging  in  a  
Socratic  dialogue  with  the  therapist,  carrying  out  homework  assignments,  doing  
behavioral experiments, gathering data on assumptions made, and forming alterna-
tive  interpretations  (Dattilio,  2000a;  Freeman  &  Dattilio,  1994;  Tompkins,  2004,  
2006). From the start of treatment, clients learn to employ specific problem-solving 
and  coping  skills.  Through  a  process  of  guided  discovery,  clients  acquire  insight  
about the connection between their thinking and the ways they act and feel.
Cognitive therapy is focused on present problems, regardless of a client’s diag-
nosis. The past may be brought into therapy when the therapist considers it essen-
tial to understand how and when certain core dysfunctional beliefs originated and 
how these ideas have a current impact on the client’s difficulties (Dattilio, 2002a). 
The goals of this brief therapy include providing symptom relief, assisting clients in 
resolving their most pressing problems, changing beliefs and behaviors that main-
tain problems, and teaching clients skills that serve as relapse prevention strategies.
Some Differences Between CT and REBT In both CT and REBT, reality testing 
is highly organized. Clients come to realize on an experiential level that they have 
misconstrued  situations.  Yet  there  are  some  important  differences  between  these  
two approaches, especially with respect to therapeutic methods and style.
REBT is often highly directive, persuasive, and confrontational, and the teach-
ing role of the therapist is emphasized. The therapist models rational thinking and 
helps clients to identify and dispute irrational beliefs. In contrast, CT uses Socratic 
dialogue,  posing  open-ended  questions  to  clients  with  the  aim  of  getting  clients  
to  reflect  on  personal  issues  and  arrive  at  their  own  conclusions.  CT  places  more  
emphasis  on  helping  clients  identify  misconceptions  for  themselves  rather  than  
being  taught.  Through  this  reflective  questioning  process,  the  cognitive  therapist  
collaborates with clients in testing the validity of their cognitions (a process called 
collaborative empiricism). Therapeutic change is the result of clients reevaluating 
faulty beliefs based on contradictory evidence that they have gathered.
There are also differences in how Ellis and Beck view faulty thinking. Through 
a  process  of  rational  disputation,  Ellis  works  to  persuade  clients  that  certain  of  
their  beliefs  are  irrational  and  nonfunctional.  Beck  views  his  clients’  distorted  
beliefs as being the result of cognitive errors rather than being driven solely by irra-
tional  beliefs.  Beck  asks  his  clients  to  conduct  behavioral  experiments  to  test  the  
accuracy  of  their  beliefs  (Hollon  &  DiGiuseppe,  2011).  Cognitive  therapists  view  
dysfunctional beliefs as being problematic when they are a distortion of the whole 
picture,  or  when  they  are  too  absolute,  broad,  and  extreme  (A.  Beck  &  Weishaar,  
2014). For Beck, people live by rules (underlying assumptions); they get into trouble 
when they label, interpret, and evaluate by a set of rules that are unrealistic or when 
they use the rules inappropriately or excessively. If clients decide they are living by 
rules that are likely to lead to misery, the therapist asks clients to consider and test 
out alternative rules. Although cognitive therapy operates within clients’ frame of 
reference, the therapist continually asks clients to examine evidence for and against 
their belief system.

The Client–Therapist Relationship
The  therapeutic  relationship  is  basic  to  the  application  of  cognitive  therapy.  
Through  his  writings,  it  is  clear  that  Beck  believes  effective  therapists  must  com-
bine empathy and sensitivity with technical competence (A. Beck, 1987). The core 
therapeutic  conditions  described  by  Rogers  in  his  person-centered  approach  are  
viewed by cognitive therapists as being necessary, but not sufficient, to produce opti-
mum therapeutic effect. A therapeutic alliance is a necessary first step in cognitive 
therapy, especially in counseling difficult-to-reach clients. Without a working alli-
ance, techniques applied will not be effective (Dattilio & Hanna, 2012; Dienes et al., 
2011). Therapists must have a cognitive conceptualization of cases, be creative and 
active, be able to engage clients through a process of Socratic questioning, and be 
knowledgeable  and  skilled  in  the  use  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  strategies  aimed  
at guiding clients in significant self-discoveries that will lead to change (A. Beck & 
Weishaar, 2014).
Cognitive  therapists  are  continuously  active  and  deliberately  interactive  with  
clients, helping clients frame their conclusions in the form of testable hypotheses. 
The cognitive therapist functions as a catalyst and a guide who helps clients under-
stand  how  their  beliefs  and  attitudes  influence  the  way  they  feel  and  act.  Clients  
are  expected  to  identify  the  distortions  in  their  thinking,  summarize  important  
points  in  the  session,  and  collaboratively  devise  homework  assignments  that  they  
agree to carry out. Cognitive therapists emphasize the client’s role in self-discovery. 
The assumption is that lasting changes in the client’s thinking and behavior will be 
most likely to occur with the client’s initiative, understanding, awareness, and effort 
(A. Beck & Weishaar, 2014; J. Beck, 2005, 2011a; J. Beck & Butler, 2005).
Cognitive  therapists  identify  specific,  measurable  goals  and  move  directly  
into the areas that are causing the most difficulty for clients (Dienes et al., 2011). 
Typically,  a  therapist  will  educate  clients  about  the  nature  and  course  of  their  
problem,  about  the  process  of  cognitive  therapy,  and  how  thoughts  influence  
their  emotions  and  behaviors..  One  way  of  educating  clients  is  through  biblio-
therapy, in which clients complete readings that support and expand their under-
standing  of  cognitive  therapy  principles  and  skills.  These  readings  are  assigned  
as an adjunct to therapy and are designed to enhance the therapeutic process by 
providing  an  educational  focus  (Dattilio  &  Freeman,  2007;  Jacobs,  2008).  Self-
help books such as Mind Over Mood (Greenberger & Padesky, 2016) also provide 
an educational focus.
Homework is often used as a part of cognitive therapy because practicing cogni-
tive  behavioral  skills  in  real  life  facilitates  more  rapid  and  enduring  gains  (Dienes  
et al., 2011). The purpose of homework is not merely to teach clients new skills but 
also to enable them to test their beliefs and to try out different behaviors in daily-
life  situations.  Homework  is  generally  presented  to  clients  as  an  experiment  that  
serves to continue work on issues addressed in a therapy session (Dattilio, 2002b). 
Cognitive therapists realize that clients are more likely to complete homework if it is 
tailored to their needs, if they participate in designing the homework, if they begin 
the homework in the therapy session, and if they talk about potential problems in 
implementing the homework (J. Beck, 2005). Tompkins (2004, 2006) points out that 
there are clear advantages to the therapist and the client working in a collaborative

manner  in  negotiating  mutually  agreeable  homework  tasks.  One  indicator  of  a  
good  therapeutic  alliance  is  whether  homework  is  done  and  done  well  (Kazantzis,  
Dattilio, Cummins, & Clayton, 2014).
Applications of Cognitive Therapy
Cognitive therapy initially gained recognition as an approach to treating depres-
sion, but extensive research has been devoted to the study and treatment of many 
other  psychiatric  disorders.  The  popularity  of  cognitive  therapy  is  due  in  part  
to  the  “strong  empirical  support  for  its  theoretical  framework  and  to  the  large  
number of outcome studies with clinical populations” (A. Beck & Weishaar, 2014, 
p.  260).  Hundreds  of  research  studies  have  confirmed  the  theoretical  underpin-
nings  of  CT,  and  hundreds  of  outcome  trials  have  established  its  efficacy  for  a  
wide range of psychiatric disorders, psychological problems, and medical condi-
tions with psychological components (Hofmann et al., 2012).
Cognitive therapy has been successfully used to treat depression, each of the anxiety 
disorders,  cannabis  dependence,  hypochondriasis,  body  dysmorphic  disorder,  eating  
disorders, anger, schizophrenia, insomnia, and chronic pain (Chambless & Peterman, 
2006; Dattilio & Kendall, 2007; Hofmann et al., 2012; Riskind, 2006); suicidal behavior, 
borderline  personality  disorders,  narcissistic  personality  disorders,  and  schizophrenic  
disorders (Dattilio & Freeman, 2007); personality disorders (Pretzer & Beck, 2006); sub-
stance abuse (Newman, 2006); medical illness (Dattilio & Castaldo, 2001); crisis inter-
vention (Dattilio & Freeman, 2007); couples and families therapy (Dattilio, 1993, 1998, 
2001, 2005, 2010; Dattilio & Padesky, 1990; Epstein, 2006); and child abusers, divorce 
counseling,  skills  training,  and  stress  management  (Dattilio,  1998;  Granvold,  1994;  
Reinecke,  Dattilio,  &  Freeman,  2002).  With  children  and  adolescents,  CT  has  been  
shown  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  depression  and  anxiety  disorders  and  more  
effective than medications for these problems. Clearly, cognitive therapy programs have 
been designed for all ages and for a variety of client populations.
Moreover,  the  effects  of  CT  for  depression  and  anxiety  disorders  seem  to  be  
more enduring that the effects of other treatments, with the exception of behavior 
therapy, which sometimes matches CT in duration of positive outcome. People who 
get better using CT are less likely to relapse than those who improve with medica-
tion or most other psychotherapy approaches (Hollon et al., 2006). For an excellent 
resource on the clinical applications of cognitive therapy to a wide range of disorders 
and populations, see Contemporary Cognitive Therapy (Leahy, 2006a).
Applying Cognitive Techniques Beck and Weishaar (2014) describe both cognitive 
and  behavioral  methods  that  are  part  of  the  overall  strategies  used  by  cognitive  
therapists. Cognitive methods focus on identifying and examining a client’s beliefs, 
exploring the origins of these beliefs, and modifying them if the evidence does not 
support these beliefs. Examples of behavioral techniques typically used by cognitive 
therapists  include  activity  scheduling,  behavioral  experiments,  skills  training,  role  
playing, behavioral rehearsal, and exposure therapy. Regardless of the nature of the 
specific problem, the cognitive therapist is mainly interested in applying procedures 
that  will  assist  individuals  in  making  alternative  interpretations  of  events  in  their  
daily living and behaving in ways that move them closer to their goals and values.

Section 299

288            CHAPTER TEN
Treatment Approaches The length and course of cognitive therapy varies greatly 
and is determined by the therapy protocols used for specific diagnoses. For example, 
cognitive  therapy  for  depression  generally  lasts  16  to  20  sessions  and  begins  with  
behavioral  activation.  Activity  has  an  antidepressant  effect,  especially  when  the  
client engages in a mix of pleasurable, accomplished, and anti-avoidance activities. 
Clients  rate  their  moods  in  relation  to  the  activities  they  do  throughout  the  day,  
and  these  observations  are  used  as  guides  to  find  activities  that  provide  a  mood  
boost  in  subsequent  weeks.  As  depression  begins  to  lift,  the  therapist  introduces  
additional  skills  such  as  thought  records,  which  help  clients  identify  negative  
automatic thoughts and test them. When evidence does not support the automatic 
thought, clients learn to generate alternative explanations that are less depressing. 
When evidence does support the problematic thought, clients are helped to create 
an action  plan  to  solve  the  problem  rather  than  ruminating  on  it  (Greenberger  
&  Padesky,  2016).  Before  the  end  of  treatment,  underlying  assumptions  that  put  
clients  at  risk  for  relapse  are  examined  such  as  perfectionistic  assumptions  (“If  I  
make a mistake, then I am worthless”). These assumptions are tested with behavioral 
experiments. For example, a perfectionistic client may intentionally make a mistake 
doing a particular task and evaluate whether there is still some worth and value to 
the outcome.
In  contrast,  cognitive  therapy  for  panic  disorder  generally  lasts  only  6  to  
12  sessions  and  targets  catastrophic  beliefs  about  internal  physical  and  mental  
sensations (Clark et al., 1999). Clients are helped to identify the sensations that 
trigger  a  panic  attack  and  the  catastrophic  beliefs  about  these  sensations.  For  
example, a client may think, “My heart is racing (sensation). That means I am hav-
ing a heart attack (catastrophic belief).” The therapist helps the client generate an 
alternative hypothesis to explain these feared sensations. For example, “A racing 
heart is not dangerous. It can be caused by exercise, anxiety, caffeine, and many 
other things. The heart is a muscle, and doctors recommend that you regularly 
raise your heart rate in exercise to keep it healthy.” The therapist then guides the 
client to conduct a series of experiments in a session in which the client creates 
the  sensation  and  weighs  evidence  in  support  of  the  catastrophic  and  alterna-
tive  hypotheses.  Once  the  client  begins  to  believe  the  alternative  hypotheses  in  
these experiments, which later are also done outside of therapy, panic attacks are 
reduced or disappear.
Application  to  Family  Therapy  The  cognitive  behavioral  approach  focuses  on  
cognitions, emotions, and behavior as they exert a mutual influence on one another 
within family relationships to cause dysfunction. Cognitive theory (A. Beck, 1976; 
A.  Beck  &  Haigh,  2014)  emphasizes  schema,  elsewhere  defined  as  core  beliefs,  as  
key aspect of the therapeutic process. Therapists help families restructure distorted 
beliefs (or schema) in order to change dysfunctional behaviors. Some CT therapists 
place a strong emphasis on examining cognitions among individual family members 
as well as on what may be termed the “family schemata” (Dattilio, 1993, 1998, 2001, 
2010). These jointly held beliefs about the family have formed as a result of years of 
interaction among family members. These schemata are influenced by the parents’ 
family of origin and have a major impact on how each individual thinks, feels, and 
behaves in the family system (Dattilio, 2001, 2005, 2010).

Christine Padesky and Kathleen Mooney’s Strengths-Based 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Introduction
Strengths-based cognitive behavior therapy (SB-CBT) is a variant of Aaron Beck’s cog-
nitive  therapy  developed  by  Christine  Padesky  and  her  colleague  Kathleen  Mooney  
(Padesky  &  Mooney,  2012).  All  the  principles  and  evidence-based  treatments  devel-
oped  by  Aaron  Beck  and  his  colleagues  are  incorporated  in  strengths-based  CBT.   
CHRISTINE  A.  PADESKY  (b.  1953)  was  
born  and  raised  in  the  Midwest.  As  an  
undergraduate   science   major   at   Yale   
University, she took a psychology course 
and  became  fascinated  with  this  field,  
which  offered  a  link  between  her  scien-
tific  and  social  change  interests.  While  
a PhD student in clinical psychology at 
the  University  of  California,  Los  Ange-
les,  Padesky  and  her  graduate  research  
adviser  published  an  article  on  gender  
differences   in   depression   symptoms   
that   caught   the   attention   of   Aaron   
Beck.  Beck  and  Padesky  met  and  became  friends,  
and  he  was  her  mentor  throughout  her  career  (see  
Padesky,  2004).  In  the  1980s  she  and  Beck  taught  
more  than  20  workshops  together  in  the  United  
States and abroad.
At  Beck’s  invitation,  in  1983  Padesky  opened  
one of the first Centers for Cognitive Therapy in the 
western  United  States  (now  located  in  Huntington  
Beach, California). She partnered in this venture with 
Kathleen Mooney, a creative CBT therapist dedicated 
to innovation and therapist education. Together they 
trained and hired staff for their clinic, which became 
a  leading  international  training  center.  Padesky  and  
Mooney developed many innovations in the practice 
of cognitive therapy including the use of constructive 
questions,  the  importance  of  identifying  
client  imagery  and  metaphors  for  change,  
and an emphasis on client strengths. These 
innovations eventually formed the founda-
tion  of  their  therapy  approach,  known  as  
strengths-based CBT (SB-CBT).
In   1995,   Greenberger   and   Padesky   
(2016)   first   published   Mind   Over   Mood:   
Change How You Feel by Changing the Way You 
Think,  which  became  a  popular  self-help  
sensation.  With  sales  of  more  than  one  
million copies worldwide in 23 languages, 
Padesky’s  dream  of  teaching  people  skills  
to improve their own moods so they did not need to 
rely on experts was realized.
Padesky  lectures  and  teaches  workshops  in  the  
United States and abroad. She is a consultant to thera-
pists and clinics worldwide and participates in a num-
ber  of  research  programs  evaluating  strengths-based  
CBT.  She  was  a  featured  presenter  at  the  Evolution  
of  Psychotherapy  conference  in  2013  and  the  Brief  
Therapy conference in 2014. In addition to Mind Over 
Mood,  she  has  written  four  professional  books  and  
numerous  articles  and  book  chapters  on  a  variety  of  
CBT topics. She produces top-rated video demonstra-
tions  of  CBT  in  action  and  has  an  extensive  catalog  
of audio training programs for mental health profes-
sionals and graduate students in mental health fields.

As the name implies, one central addition of SB-CBT is an emphasis on identification 
and integration of client strengths at each phase of therapy. The main idea of sb-cbt 
is that active incorporation of client strengths encourages clients to engage more fully 
in therapy and often provides avenues for change that otherwise would be missed.
SB-CBT  expands  previous  models  of  CBT  to  include  methods  that  help  people  
develop positive qualities. Their ideas developed in parallel with positive psychology, 
a research field that investigates happiness, resilience, altruism, and a host of positive 
emotions and behaviors (Lopez & Snyder, 2011). In a keynote address at an interna-
tional  conference,  Padesky  (2007)  proposed  that  the  next  frontier  in  psychotherapy  
would  be  development  of  methods  to  enhance  human  experience  and  strengths  
instead of working solely to alleviate suffering. SB-CBT is a step in that direction.
Basic Principles of Strengths-Based CBT
Like cognitive therapy, SB-CBT is empirically based. This means that (1) thera-
pists should be knowledgeable about evidence-based approaches pertaining to client 
issues discussed in therapy, (2) clients are asked to make observations and describe 
the details of their life experiences so what is developed in therapy is based in the real 
data of clients’ lives, and (3) therapists and clients collaborate in testing beliefs and 
experimenting with new behaviors to see if they help achieve desired goals.
Strengths are integrated into each phase of treatment in SB-CBT beginning with 
the intake interview. After reasons for seeking therapy are described and explored, 
the  SB-CBT  therapist  expresses  an  interest  in  positive  aspects  of  the  client’s  life:  
“Thank you for telling me about the reasons you came to therapy. Even though this 
is a tough time for you, I wonder if there are some things that are going well in your 
life or that bring you happiness, even now. If you are willing to tell me about some of 
those things, it will help me know you more as a whole person.”
In Collaborative  Case  Conceptualization:  Working  Effectively  With  Clients  in  CBT, 
Kuyken,  Padesky,  and  Dudley  (2009)  show  how  positive  interests  and  strengths  
identified in early therapy sessions can provide a wealth of information to help ther-
apist and client collaboratively integrate strengths into case conceptualization and 
treatment. For example, clients often discover that they use more resilient strategies 
when they encounter obstacles in areas of positive interest than they do in problem 
areas of their life. These strategies can be added to plans to deal positively with prob-
lem areas. A depressed client learning to be more active to boost mood will have an 
easier time engaging in activities that are part of a hobby or positive pastime than 
participating in activities that hold little interest for the client.
SB-CBT therapists help clients develop and construct new positive ways of inter-
acting  in  the  world.  The  SB-CBT  model  for  building  and  strengthening  personal  
resilience can be used on its own or integrated with another evidenced-based CBT 
treatment  for  a  diagnostic  disorder  (Padesky  &  Mooney,  2012).  For  clients  with  
chronic difficulties that have proven resistant to change, SB-CBT proposes that it is 
often easier to construct an entirely new way of doing things than to problem solve 
or modify a chronic way of doing things. When clients do not respond to standard 
treatments,  SB-CBT  therapists  help  clients  co-create  a  “NEW  Paradigm,”  which  is  
their vision of how they would like to be and how they would like the difficult area 
of their life to be.

The Client–Therapist Relationship
As with Beck’s cognitive therapy, SB-CBT therapists are collaborative, active, here-
and-now focused, and client-centered. SB-CBT therapists are encouraging allies of 
their  clients  and  need  to  be  genuine,  caring,  and  willing  to  engage  with  clients  as  
full human beings in both struggles and successes. SB-CBT therapists do not take 
an “expert” stance but instead serve as curious assistants or guides to their clients’ 
own discovery and growth.
SB-CBT practitioners ask clients for imagery and metaphors to describe their expe-
riences, both positive and negative. More than words, imagery and metaphors capture 
and  integrate  the  emotional,  cognitive,  physiological,  and  behavioral  aspects  of  expe-
rience.  In  addition  to  deconstructing  beliefs  and  problems,  SB-CBT  emphasizes  the  
constructive use of Socratic questioning. The SB-CBT therapist asks constructive ques-
tions such as, “How would you like to be? “How would you like this part of your life 
or relationships to be?” When clients are stuck in recurring patterns, SB-CBT teaches 
them  that  we  do  things  “for  good  reasons”  and  shows  clients  how  even  destructive  
behaviors (such as cutting oneself when distressed) are done for self-protective reasons 
and as attempts to cope (“If I cut myself, then I will feel some emotional relief.”).
Applications of Strengths-Based CBT
Three  current  applications  for  SB-CBT  are  as  (1)  an  add-on  for  classic  CBT,  (2)  a  
four-step  model  to  build  resilience  and  other  positive  qualities,  and  (3)  the  NEW  
Paradigm for chronic difficulties and personality disorders. SB-CBT operates as an 
add-on to classic CBT when clients come to therapy with goals to reduce problematic 
moods (depression, anxiety, anger), behaviors (eating disorders, substance misuse) or 
other  difficulties  (psychoses,  hypochondriasis)  for  which  there  are  well-established  
and effective CBT protocols. In those cases, SB-CBT therapists help clients identify 
their strengths and rely on these whenever helpful to guide therapy choices.
The four-step model to build resilience provides a template for building positive 
qualities (Padesky & Mooney, 2012). Their four steps are (1) search, (2) construct, 
(3)  apply,  and  (4)  practice.  Padesky  and  Mooney  point  out  that  there  are  usually  
just  a  few  common  pathways  to  a  psychological  disorder,  but  there  are  thousands  
of  pathways  to  resilience.  Rather  than  teach  clients  particular  ways  to  be  resilient,  
Padesky and Mooney suggest that therapists inquire about activities in clients’ lives 
that are going well and that clients do on a regular basis. These everyday activities 
clients are motivated to do are areas of strength. This search for strengths is the first 
step in their model.
The  second  step  is  to  discover  what  obstacles  clients  encounter  while  doing  
these activities and how they manage these obstacles. A central idea is that everybody 
encounters  obstacles  in  any  frequently  practiced  activity  but  we  manage  obstacles  
without  even  realizing  that  is  what  we  are  doing  when  we  enjoy  the  activity.  For  
example, Joseph loves to play video games. He uses a variety of strategies to manage 
obstacles  as  they  occur  within  the  game  and  from  external  causes  (such  as  loss  of  
power to his electronic device). Joseph’s strategies include problem solving, seeking 
help from friends, reminding himself that “I’ve been stuck before and always found 
a way through,” and music to keep up his energy. These strategies are written down 
as his Personal Model of Resilience (PMR).

292            CHAPTER TEN
The third step involves the therapist helping Joseph creatively consider how he 
can apply his PMR to remain resilient in a more problematic area of his life, such as 
dating. Joseph makes a plan for how to use these strategies to help him meet people 
he would like to date, ask them out, and solve various dating difficulties than have 
proven challenging for him in the past.
The  fourth  stage  involves  Joseph  conducting  a  series  of  dating  experiments  
while he practices maintaining a focus on resilience. A key to this stage of the ther-
apy is that Joseph sets a goal to “be resilient in the face of challenges,” not to succeed 
at dating. Because his goal is to “stay resilient” he has a better chance of experiencing 
his dates in a positive way. Even if he and his date don’t get along, he can feel good 
about  staying  resilient.  This  can  help  Joseph  feel  motivated  no  matter  what  hap-
pens. Over time, his resilience will be expressed both in persistence (problem solving, 
getting help from friends) and in acceptance that not every date will turn out as he 
would like (but he can enjoy the music anyway).
The same principles can be used to build other positive qualities such as altru-
ism,  creativity,  and  courage.  The  key  is  to  find  everyday  areas  of  the  person’s  life  
where  these  qualities  are  already  in  evidence.  For  example,  even  a  self-centered  
person  may  be  very  kind  and  concerned  for  a  pet  or  certain  friends.  From  these  
everyday experiences, the person can be helped to build a Personal Model of X (for 
example, altruism) and then consider how to apply and practice this positive qual-
ity in other life settings.
The  final  application  of  SB-CBT  is  the  NEW  Paradigm  for  chronic  issues  and  
personality disorders. This approach is more comprehensive and requires clients to 
vividly  construct  new  ways  to  feel,  think,  and  behave  in  their  life.  The  four  steps  
of this model are (1) Conceptualize the OLD System of operating and help clients 
understand they do things “for good reasons,” (2) construct NEW systems of how 
clients would like to be, (3) strengthen the NEW using behavioral experiments to try 
on NEW ways of being and edit them as needed, and (4) relapse management. Thera-
pists need significant training to practice the NEW Paradigm because it is essential 
that the therapist stay alert to identify when the OLD System interferes with client 
learning. The therapist must be able to help the client learn from every experience 
and process this learning through the NEW System, not the OLD.

of  the  founders  of  cognitive  behavior  
therapy,  and  in  a  survey  of  clinicians  
he  was  voted  one  of  the  most  influen-

Donald Meichenbaum’s Cognitive Behavior Modification
Introduction
Donald Meichenbaum’s cognitive behavior modification (CBM) focuses on chang-
ing the client’s self-talk. According to Meichenbaum (1977), self-statements affect a 
person’s behavior in much the same way as statements made by another person. A 
basic premise of CBM is that clients, as a prerequisite to behavior change, must notice 
how they think, feel, and behave and the impact they have on others. For change to 
occur, clients need to interrupt the scripted nature of their behavior so that they can 
evaluate their behavior in various situations (Meichenbaum, 1993, 2007).
This approach shares with REBT and Beck’s cognitive therapy the assumption 
that  distressing  emotions  are  often  the  result  of  maladaptive  thoughts.  REBT  is  
more direct and confrontational in uncovering and disputing irrational thoughts, 
whereas  Meichenbaum’s  self-instructional  training  focuses  more  on  helping  clients  
become aware of their self-talk and the stories they tell about themselves. Both REBT 
and  CT  focus  on  changing  thinking  processes,  but  Meichenbaum  suggests  that  it  
may be easier and more effective to change our behavior rather than our thinking. 
Furthermore,  our  emotions  and  thinking  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin:  the  way  
we feel can affect our way of thinking, just as how we think can influence how we 
feel.  The  therapeutic  process  consists  of  teaching  clients  to  make  self-statements  
and training clients to modify the instructions they give to themselves so that they 
can  cope  more  effectively  with  the  problems  they  encounter.  Cognitive  restructur-
ing  plays  a  central  role  in  Meichenbaum’s  (1977,  1993)  self-instructional  training.  
He describes cognitive structure as the organizing aspect of thinking, which moni-
tors and directs the choice of thoughts through an “executive processor” that “holds 
the blueprints of thinking” that determines when to continue, interrupt, or change 
thinking. Together, therapist and client practice the self-instructions and the desir-
able behaviors in role-play situations that simulate problem situations in the client’s 
daily life. The emphasis is on acquiring practical coping skills for problematic situ-
ations such as impulsive and aggressive behavior, anxiety in social situations, fear of 
taking tests, eating problems, and fear of public speaking.
Meichenbaum attributes the origin of CBT to his 
mother, who had a knack for telling stories about her 
daily activities that were peppered with her thoughts, 
feelings, and a running commentary. This childhood 
experience  contributed  to  Meichenbaum’s  psycho-
therapeutic   approach   of   constructivist   narrative   
therapy, in which clients tell their stories and describe 
what they did to “survive and cope.” Meichenbaum’s 
recent  work  with  returning  service  members  using  
iPod  technology  to  bolster  resilience  is  modeled  on  
this approach. When therapy is successful, Meichen-
baum ensures that clients take credit for the changes 
they  have  achieved.  As  he  observes,  “I  am  at  my  
therapeutic  best  when  the  clients  I  see  are  one  step  
ahead of me offering the observations or suggestions 
that I would otherwise offer” (Donald Meichenbaum, 
personal communication, October 21, 2010).
Meichenbaum  has  published  extensively,  includ-
ing Cognitive  Behavior  Therapy:  An  Integrative  Approach 
(1977), Stress  Inoculation  Training  (1985),  Treatment  of  
Individuals   With   Anger-Control   Problems   and   Aggressive   
Behaviors   (2002),   and   Roadmap   to   Resilience   (2012).   
He  has  lectured  in  every  state  and  in  all  provinces  in  
Canada  as  well  as  internationally.  He  was  a  featured  
presenter  at  the  Evolution  of  Psychotherapy  confer-
ence in 2013 and the Brief Therapy conference in 2014.

How Behavior Changes
Meichenbaum  (1977)  proposes  that  “behavior  change  occurs  through  a  
sequence  of  mediating  processes  involving  the  interaction  of  inner  speech,  cogni-
tive structures, and behaviors and their resultant outcomes” (p. 218). He describes 
a  three-phase  process  of  change  in  which  those  three  aspects  are  interwoven  and  
believes that focusing on only one aspect will probably prove insufficient.
Phase 1: Self-observation. Clients learning how to observe their own behavior. 
When clients begin therapy, their internal dialogue is characterized by nega-
tive self-statements and imagery. A critical factor is their willingness and 
ability to listen to themselves. This process involves an increased sensitivity 
to their thoughts, feelings, actions, physiological reactions, and ways of 
reacting to others. If depressed clients hope to make constructive changes, 
for example, they must first realize that they are not “victims” of negative 
thoughts and feelings. Rather, they are actually contributing to their depres-
sion through the things they tell themselves. Although self-observation is 
necessary if change is to occur, it is not sufficient for change.
Phase 2: Starting a new internal dialogue. As a result of the early client–
therapist contacts, clients learn to notice their maladaptive behaviors, 
and they begin to see opportunities for adaptive behavioral alternatives. If 
clients hope to change what they are telling themselves, they must initiate 
a new behavioral chain, one that is incompatible with their maladaptive 
behaviors. Clients learn that psychological distress is a function of the 
interdependence of cognitions, emotions, behaviors, and resultant conse-
quences. In therapy, clients learn to change their internal dialogue, which 
serves as a guide to new behavior.
Phase 3: Learning new skills. Clients learn to interrupt the downward spiral 
of thinking, feeling, and behaving, and the therapist teaches clients more 
adaptive ways of coping using the resources they bring to therapy. Clients 
learn more effective coping skills, which are practiced in real-life situa-
tions. As they behave differently in situations, they typically get different 
reactions from others. The stability of what they learn is greatly influenced 
by what they say to themselves about their newly acquired behavior and its 
consequences.
Stress Inoculation Training
A particular application of a coping skills program is teaching clients stress 
management techniques by way of a strategy known as stress inoculation training 
(SIT). Using cognitive techniques, Meichenbaum (1985, 2007, 2008) has developed 
stress  inoculation  procedures  that  are  a  psychological  and  behavioral  analog  to  
immunization on a biological level. Individuals are given opportunities to deal with 
relatively mild stress stimuli in successful ways, and they gradually develop a toler-
ance  for  stronger  stimuli.  This  training  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  we  can  
affect  our  ability  to  cope  with  stress  by  modifying  our  beliefs  and  self-statements  
about  our  performance  in  stressful  situations.  Meichenbaum’s  stress  inoculation

training is concerned with more than merely teaching people specific coping skills. 
His program is designed to prepare clients for intervention and motivate them to 
change, and it deals with issues such as resistance and relapse.
Stress  inoculation  training  is  a  combination  of  information  giving,  Socratic  
discovery-oriented  inquiry,  cognitive  restructuring,  problem  solving,  relaxation  
training, behavioral rehearsals, self-monitoring, self-instruction, self-reinforcement, 
and modifying environmental situations (Meichenbaum, 2008). Collaborative goals 
are  set  that  nurture  hope,  direct-action  skills,  and  acceptance-based  coping  skills.  
These coping skills are designed to be applied to both present problems and future 
difficulties.  Clients  are  assisted  in  generalizing  what  they  have  learned  so  they  can  
use these skills in daily living, and relapse prevention strategies are taught. Meichen-
baum (2008) describes stress inoculation training as a complex, multifaceted, cogni-
tive behavioral intervention that is both a preventive and a treatment approach.
Clients can acquire more effective strategies in dealing with stressful situations 
by learning how to modify their cognitive “set,” or core beliefs. The following proce-
dures are designed to teach these coping skills:
Expose clients to anxiety-provoking situations by means of role playing 
and imagery
Require clients to evaluate their anxiety level
Teach clients to become aware of the anxiety-provoking cognitions they 
experience in stressful situations
Help clients examine these thoughts by reevaluating their 
self-statements
Have clients note the level of anxiety following this reevaluation
The Phases of Stress Inoculation Training Meichenbaum (2007,  2008) has designed 
a three-stage model for stress inoculation training: (1) the conceptual-educational 
phase,  (2)  the  skills  acquisition  and  consolidation  phase,  and  (3)  the  application  
and follow-through phase.
During  the  conceptual-educational  phase,  the  primary  focus  is  on  creating  a  ther-
apeutic  alliance  with  clients.  This  is  done  by  helping  clients  gain  a  better  under-
standing of the nature of stress and reconceptualizing it in social-interactive terms. 
Initially, clients are provided with a conceptual framework in simple terms designed 
to educate them about ways of responding to a variety of stressful situations. They 
learn  about  the  role  cognitions  and  emotions  play  in  creating  and  maintaining  
stress  through  didactic  presentations,  by  curious  questioning,  and  by  a  process  of  
guided self-discovery. A collaborative relationship is created during this early phase, 
and together they rethink the stress concerns clients bring to understand the nature 
of the problem.
Clients  often  begin  treatment  feeling  that  they  are  victims  of  external  circum-
stances, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors over which they have no control. As a way 
to  understand  the  subjective  world  of  clients,  the  therapist  generally  elicits  stories  
that  clients  tell  themselves.  Training  includes  teaching  clients  to  become  aware  of  
their own role in creating their stress and their life stories. They acquire this aware-
ness  by  systematically  observing  the  statements  they  make  internally  as  well  as  by  
monitoring  the  maladaptive  behaviors  that  flow  from  this  inner  dialogue.  Such

self-monitoring  continues  throughout  all  the  phases.  As  is  true  in  cognitive  ther-
apy, clients typically keep an open-ended diary in which they systematically monitor 
and record their specific thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In teaching these coping 
skills, therapists strive to be flexible in their use of techniques and to be sensitive to 
the individual, cultural, and situational circumstances of their clients.
During  the  skills  acquisition  and  consolidation  phase,  the  focus  is  on  giving  clients  a  
variety of behavioral and cognitive coping skills to apply to stressful situations. This 
phase involves direct actions, such as gathering information about their fears, learning 
specifically what situations bring about stress, arranging for ways to lessen the stress 
by  doing  something  different,  and  learning  methods  of  physical  and  psychological  
relaxation. The training involves cognitive coping; clients are taught that adaptive and 
maladaptive  behaviors  are  linked  to  their  inner  dialogue.  Through  this  training,  cli-
ents acquire and rehearse a new set of self-statements. Meichenbaum (1986) provides 
some examples of coping statements that are rehearsed in this phase of SIT:
“How can I prepare for a stressor?” (“What do I have to do? Can I 
develop a plan to deal with the stress?”)
“How can I confront and deal with what is stressing me?” (“What are 
some ways I can handle a stressor? How can I meet this challenge?”)
“How can I cope with feeling overwhelmed?” (“What can I do right 
now? How can I keep my fears in check?”)
“How can I make reinforcing self-statements?” (“How can I give myself 
credit?”)
Clients  also  are  exposed  to  various  behavioral  interventions,  such  as  relaxation  
training, social skills training, time-management instruction, and self-instructional 
training.  They  are  helped  to  make  lifestyle  changes  by  reevaluating  priorities,  
developing  support  systems,  and  taking  direct  action  to  alter  stressful  situations.  
Through  teaching,  demonstration,  and  guided  practice,  clients  learn  the  skills  of  
progressive relaxation and practice them regularly to decrease arousal due to stress.
During the application and follow-through phase, the focus is on carefully arranging 
for transfer and maintenance of change from the therapeutic situation to everyday 
life. Clients practice their new self-statements and apply their new skills to everyday 
life. To consolidate the lessons learned in the training sessions, clients participate in 
a variety of activities, including imagery and behavior rehearsal, role playing, model-
ing, and graded in-vivo exposure. Once clients have become proficient in cognitive 
and  behavioral  coping  skills,  they  practice  behavioral  assignments,  which  become  
increasingly demanding. They are asked to write down the homework assignments 
they  are  willing  to  complete.  The  outcomes  of  these  assignments  are  carefully  
checked  at  subsequent  meetings,  and  if  clients  do  not  follow  through  with  them,  
the therapist and the client collaboratively consider the reasons for the failure.
relapse  prevention,  which  consists  of  procedures  for  dealing  with  the  inevi-
table setbacks clients are likely to experience as they apply what they are learning to 
daily life, is taught at this stage (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005). Clients learn to view any 
lapses that occur as “learning opportunities” rather than as “catastrophic failures.” 
Clients explore a variety of possible high-risk, stressful situations that they may reex-
perience.  In  a  collaborative  fashion  with  the  therapist,  and  with  other  clients  in  a

the gains they have made. Follow-up and booster sessions typically take place at 3-, 
6-, and 12-month periods as an incentive for clients to continue practicing and refin-
ing their coping skills. SIT can be considered part of an ongoing stress management 
program that extends the benefits of training into the future.
Stress inoculation training has potentially useful applications for a wide variety 
of  problems  and  clients  and  for  both  remediation  and  prevention.  Clinical  appli-
cations  of  SIT  are  individually  tailored  to  specific  target  populations  and  include  
anger  control,  pain  control,  anxiety  management,  assertion  training,  improving  
creative thinking, treating depression, dealing with health problems, and preparing 
for  surgery.  Stress  inoculation  training  has  been  employed  with  medical  patients  
and with psychiatric patients. Meichenbaum (2007) contends that the flexibility of 
the SIT format has contributed to its robust effectiveness. SIT has been successfully 
used with children, adolescents, and adults who have anger problems, anxiety dis-
orders,  phobias,  social  incompetence,  addictions,  alcoholism,  sexual  dysfunctions,  
social withdrawal, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including use with vet-
erans  who  experience  combat-related  PTSD  (Meichenbaum,  1993,  1994a,  1994b,  
2007, 2008, 2012).
A Cognitive Narrative Approach to Cognitive Behavior Therapy
Meichenbaum (2015) has embraced a cognitive narrative perspective, which focuses 
on  the  plots,  characters,  and  themes  in  the  stories  people  tell  about  themselves  
and others regarding significant events in their lives. Therapists elicit stories from 
their clients that are explored in the therapy process. This approach begins with the 
assumption that there are multiple realities. One of the therapeutic tasks is to help 
clients appreciate how they construct their realities and how they author their own 
stories (see Chapter 13). Meichenbaum claims that we are all “story tellers” and that 
we  should  be  aware  of  the  stories  we  tell  ourselves  and  others.  For  example,  some  
clients  might  see  themselves  as  “prisoners  of  the  past”  or  as  “stubborn  victims.”  
These  phrases  are  not  idle  metaphors;  they  are  the  organizing  schemas  that  color  
the ways individuals view themselves, their world, and their future. Therapists help 
clients appreciate how they construct reality and examine the implications and con-
clusions  clients  draw  from  their  stories.  Telling  the  “rest  of  the  story”—what  they  
did to survive and cope—bolsters clients’ strengths and helps them develop resilient-
engendering behaviors. In this way, clients can move from being “stubborn victims” 
to becoming “tenacious survivors” and perhaps “impressive thrivers.” Meichenbaum 
(2012) works in a collaborative fashion with clients to develop the coping skills neces-
sary to achieve these treatment goals. He uses a Socratic discovery-oriented approach 
and the art of questioning to assist clients in reaching their goals.
Meichenbaum (1997) uses these questions to evaluate the outcomes of therapy:
Are clients now able to tell a new story about themselves and the 
world?
Do clients now use more positive metaphors to describe themselves?
Are clients able to predict high-risk situations and employ coping skills 
in dealing with emerging problems?
Are clients able to take credit for the changes they have been able to 
bring about?

In successful therapy clients develop their own voices, take pride in what they have 
accomplished, and take ownership of the changes they are bringing about. In short, 
clients become their own therapists and take the therapist’s voice with them.
Cognitive Behavior Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Cognitive behavioral approaches have several strength in working with indi-
viduals  from  diverse  cultural,  ethnic,  and  racial  backgrounds.  If  therapists  under-
stand the core values of their culturally diverse clients, they can help clients explore 
these values and gain a full awareness of their conflicting feelings. Then the client 
and the therapist can work together to modify selected beliefs and practices. Cogni-
tive behavior therapy tends to be culturally sensitive because it uses the individual’s 
belief system, or worldview, as part of the method of self-exploration.
Because  counselors  with  a  cognitive  behavioral  orientation  function  as  teach-
ers, clients are actively involved in learning skills to deal with the problems of living. 
In  speaking  with  colleagues  who  work  with  culturally  diverse  populations,  I  have  
learned that their clients tend to appreciate the emphasis on cognition and action, 
as well as the stress on relationship issues. The collaborative approach of CBT offers 
clients  a  structured  therapy  program,  yet  the  therapist  still  makes  every  effort  to  
enlist  clients’  active  cooperation  and  participation.  According  to  Spiegler  (2013),  
because  of  its  basic  nature  and  the  way  CBT  is  practiced,  it  is  inherently  suited  to  
treating diverse clients. Some of the factors that Spiegler identifies that makes CBT 
diversity  effective  include  individualized  treatment,  focus  on  the  external  environ-
ment, active nature, emphasis on learning, reliance on empirical evidence, concern 
with present behavior, and brevity. A strength of CBT is integrating assessment of 
client  beliefs,  emotional  responses,  and  behavioral  choices  throughout  therapy,  
which communicates respect for clients’ viewpoints regarding their progress.
Hays  (2009)  asserts  there  is  an  “almost  perfect  fit”  between  cognitive  behav-
ior  therapy  and  multicultural  therapy  because  these  perspectives  share  common  
assumptions that make integration possible. Aspects that contribute to an integra-
tive framework include the following:
Interventions are tailored to the unique needs and strengths of the 
individual.
Clients are empowered by learning specific skills they can apply in daily 
life (CBT) and by the emphasis on cultural influences that contribute to 
clients’ uniqueness (multicultural therapy).
Inner resources and strengths of clients are activated to bring about change.
Clients make changes that minimize stressors, increase personal 
strengths and supports, and establish skills for dealing more effectively 
with their physical and social (cultural) environments.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Exploring  values  and  core  beliefs  plays  an  important  role  in  all  of  the  cog-
nitive  behavioral  approaches,  and  it  is  crucial  for  therapists  to  have  some

understanding of the cultural background of clients and to be sensitive to their 
struggles. REBT therapists would do well to use caution in their choice of lan-
guage  and  expression  when  confronting  clients  about  their  beliefs  and  behav-
iors. REBT suggests that the therapist’s job is to help clients critically examine 
long-standing  cultural  values  that  result  in  dysfunctional  emotions  or  behav-
iors, but a potential limitation of REBT is its negative view of dependency. Many 
cultures view interdependence as necessary to good mental health. Clients with 
long-cherished cultural values pertaining to interdependence may not respond 
favorably  to  forceful  methods  of  persuasion  toward  independence.  Skillful  
REBT practitioners carefully monitor their manner, style, and choice of words 
and communicate whenever possible in language that is congruent with the cli-
ent’s culture.
Hays  (2009)  suggests  that  therapists  avoid  challenging  the  core  cultural  
beliefs  of  clients  unless  the  client  is  clearly  open  to  this.  By  emphasizing  col-
laboration  over  confrontation,  as  the  cognitive  behavioral  approaches  do,  the  
therapist  can  avoid  seeming  to  be  disrespectful.  Hays  recommends  drawing  on  
the client’s culturally related strengths in developing helpful ways of thinking to 
replace  unhelpful  cognitions.  For  example,  consider  an  Asian  American  client,  
Sung, from a culture that stresses values such as doing one’s best, cooperation, 
interdependence, and working hard. Sung may feel that she is bringing shame to 
her family if she is going through a divorce, and she may feel guilt if she perceives 
that she is not living up to the expectations and standards set for her by her fam-
ily and her community. Sung can be helped to consider how her cultural values of 
cooperation and interdependence may enable her family to support her during a 
difficult divorce. The rules for Sung are likely to be different than are the rules for 
a male member of her culture. The counselor could assist Sung in understanding 
and exploring how both her gender and her culture are factors to consider in her 
situation. If Sung is confronted too quickly on living by the expectations or rules 
of  others,  the  results  are  likely  to  be  counterproductive.  Sung  might  even  leave  
counseling if she feels that she is not being understood.
The  emphasis  of  CBT  on  assertiveness,  independence,  verbal  ability,  ratio-
nality, cognition, and behavioral change may limit its use in cultures that value 
subtle  communication  over  assertiveness,  interdependence  over  personal  inde-
pendence,  listening  and  observing  over  talking,  and  acceptance  over  behavior  
change  (Hays,  2009).  In  CBT  the  focus  is  on  the  present,  which  can  result  in  
the therapist failing to recognize the role of the past in a client’s development. 
Cognitive behavioral assessments involve the investigation of a client’s personal 
history. If the therapist is unaware of a client’s cultural beliefs, which are rooted 
in  the  past,  the  therapist  may  have  difficulty  interpreting  the  client’s  personal  
experiences accurately.
Another  limitation  of  CBT  from  a  multicultural  perspective  involves  its  indi-
vidualistic  orientation.  An  inexperienced  therapist  may  overemphasize  cognitive  
restructuring to the neglect of environmental interventions. Hays (2009) points out 
that these potential limitations do not preclude the integration of CBT and multi-
cultural counseling. Instead, being aware of these limitations “presents opportuni-
ties for rethinking, refining, adapting and increasing the relevance and effectiveness 
of psychotherapy” (p. 356).

F
rom  a  cognitive  behavioral  perspective,  I  want  
Stan  to  critically  evaluate  and  modify  his  self-
defeating  beliefs,  which  will  likely  result  in  Stan  ac-
quiring more effective behavior. As his therapist, I am 
both  goal  oriented  and  problem  focused.  From  the  
initial session, I ask Stan to identify his problems and 
formulate specific goals and help him reconceptualize 
his problems in a way that will increase his chances of 
finding solutions.
I  follow  a  clear  structure  for  every  session.  The  
basic   procedural   sequence   includes   (1)   preparing   
him by providing a cognitive rationale for treatment 
and demystifying treatment; (2) encouraging him to 
monitor  the  thoughts  that  accompany  his  distress;  
(3)   implementing   behavioral   and   cognitive   tech-
niques;  (4)  assisting  him  in  identifying  and  examin-
ing  some  basic  beliefs  and  ideas;  (5)  teaching  him  
ways to examine his beliefs and assumptions by test-
ing them in the real world; and (6) teaching him basic 
coping skills that will enable him to avoid relapsing 
into old patterns.
As a part of the structure of the therapy sessions, 
I ask Stan for a brief review of the week, elicit feedback 
from  the  previous  session,  review  homework  assign-
ments, collaboratively create an agenda for the session, 
discuss  topics  on  the  agenda,  and  set  new  homework  
for the week. I encourage Stan to perform personal ex-
periments and practice coping skills in daily life.
Stan  tells  me  that  he  would  like  to  work  on  his  
fear of women and would hope to feel far less intimi-
dated by them. He reports that he feels threatened by 
most  women,  but  especially  by  women  he  perceives  
as  powerful.  In  working  with  Stan’s  fears,  I  proceed  
with  four  steps:  educating  him  about  his  self-talk;  
having  him  monitor  and  evaluate  his  faulty  beliefs;  
using  cognitive  and  behavioral  interventions;  and  
collaboratively  designing  homework  with  Stan  that  
will give him opportunities to practice new behaviors 
in daily life.
First,  I  educate  him  about  the  importance  of  ex-
amining  his  automatic  thoughts,  his  self-talk,  and  
the many “shoulds,” “oughts,” and “musts” he has ac-
cepted  without  questioning.  Working  with  Stan  as  a  
collaborative partner in his therapy, I guide him in dis-
covering  some  basic  thoughts  that  influence  what  he  
tells himself and how he feels and acts. Here are some 
of his beliefs:
“I always have to be strong, tough, and perfect.”
“I’m not a man if I show any signs of weakness.”
“If everyone didn’t love me and approve of me, 
things would be catastrophic.”
“If a woman rejected me, I really would be reduced 
to a ‘nothing.’”
“If I fail, I am then a failure as a person.”
“I’m apologetic for my existence because I don’t 
feel equal to others.”
Second,  I  assist  Stan  in  monitoring  and  evaluat-
ing  the  ways  in  which  he  keeps  telling  himself  these  
self-defeating  ideas.  I  assist  him  in  clarifying  specific  
problems  and  learning  how  to  critically  evaluate  his  
thinking.
Therapist: You’re not your father. I wonder why you 
continue telling yourself that you’re just like him. 
Where is the evidence that your parents were right 
in their assessment of you? What is the evidence 
they were not right in their assessment of you? You 
say you’re such a failure and that you feel inferior. 
Do your present activities support this? If you were 
not so hard on yourself, how might your life be 
different?
Third,  once  Stan  more  fully  understands  the  
nature  of  his  cognitive  distortions  and  his  self-
defeating beliefs, I draw on a variety of cognitive and 
behavioral techniques to help Stan learns to identify, 
evaluate,  and  respond  to  his  beliefs.  I  rely  heavily  
on  cognitive  techniques  such  as  Socratic  questioning,  
guided  discovery,  and  cognitive  restructuring  to  assist  
Stan  in  examining  the  evidence  that  seems  to  sup-
port or contradict his core beliefs. I work with Stan so 
he will view his basic beliefs and automatic thinking 
as hypotheses to be tested. In a way, he will become 
a  personal  scientist  by  checking  out  the  validity  of  
many of the conclusions and basic assumptions that 
contribute to his personal difficulties. By the use of

guided  discovery,  Stan  learns  to  evaluate  the  valid-
ity and functionality of his beliefs and conclusions. 
Stan  can  also  profit  from  cognitive  restructuring,  
which  would  entail  observing  his  own  behavior  in  
various situations. For example, during the week he 
can  take  a  particular  situation  that  is  problematic  
for him and pay attention to his automatic thoughts 
and  internal  dialogue:  What  is  he  telling  himself  as  
he  approaches  a  difficult  situation?  As  he  learns  to  
attend to his thoughts and behaviors, he may begin 
to see that what he tells himself has as much impact 
as  others’  statements  about  him.  He  also  sees  the  
connections between his thinking and his behavioral 
problems. With this awareness he is in an ideal place 
to  begin  to  learn  a  new,  more  functional  internal  
dialogue.
Fourth,  I  work  collaboratively  with  him  in  creat-
ing  specific  homework  assignments  to  help  him  deal  
with  his  fears.  It  is  expected  that  Stan  will  learn  new  
coping skills, which he can practice first in session and 
then in daily life situations. It is not enough for him to 
merely say new things to himself; Stan needs to apply 
his new cognitive and behavioral coping skills in vari-
ous  daily  situations.  At  one  point,  for  instance,  I  ask  
Stan  to  explore  his  fears  of  powerful  women  and  his  
reasons  for  continuing  to  tell  himself:  “They  expect  
me to be strong and perfect. If I’m not careful, they’ll 
dominate me.” His homework includes approaching a 
woman  for  a  date.  If  he  succeeds  in  getting  the  date,  
he  can  think  about  his  catastrophic  expectations  of  
what  might  happen.  What  would  be  so  terrible  if  she  
did  not  like  him  or  if  she  refused  the  date?  Stan  tells  
himself over and over that he must be approved of and 
that  if  any  woman  rebuffs  him  the  consequences  are  
more than he can bear. With practice, he learns to label 
distortions  and  is  able  to  automatically  identify  his  
negative thoughts and monitor his cognitive patterns. 
Through  a  variety  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  strate-
gies, he is able to acquire new information, change his 
basic  beliefs,  and  implement  new  and  more  effective  
behavior.
Questions for Reflection
My therapeutic style is characterized as an integra-
tive form of cognitive behavioral therapy. I borrow 
concepts and techniques from the approaches of 
Ellis, Beck, and Meichenbaum. In your work with 
Stan, what specific concepts would you borrow 
from these approaches? What cognitive behavioral 
techniques would you use? What possible advan-
tages do you see, if any, in applying an integrative 
cognitive behavioral approach in your work with 
Stan? Would there be any benefits in adding ideas 
from Padesky and Mooney’s strengths-based 
CBT?
What are some things you would most want to 
teach Stan about how cognitive behavior therapy 
works? How would you explain to him the thera-
peutic alliance and the collaborative therapeutic 
relationship?
What are some of Stan’s most prominent faulty 
beliefs that get in the way of his living fully? What 
cognitive and behavioral techniques might you use 
in helping him examine his beliefs?
Stan lives by many “shoulds” and “oughts.” His 
automatic thoughts seem to impede him from get-
ting what he wants. What techniques would you 
use to encourage guided discovery on his part?
What are some homework assignments that 
would be useful for Stan to carry out? How would 
you collaboratively design homework with Stan? 
How would you encourage him to develop action 
plans to test the validity of his thinking and his 
conclusions?

faulty  beliefs  through  the  use  of  role-reversal  and

G
wen comes in, takes a seat, and begins telling me 
about the upcoming office retreat that she has to 
attend. Gwen wants to be more accepted and connect-
ed  but  has  gotten  into  a  pattern  of  isolating  herself  
and using excuses not to socialize with others.
Gwen: I am dreading spending eight hours out in the 
country with a bunch of people I don’t really care 
to spent time with in the office! I know it’s going to 
be horrible!
Therapist: Stop for a moment and pay attention to 
your thoughts around being with your colleagues. 
What evidence do you have to support your predic-
tion about attending the retreat? [Sensing a cognitive 
distortion]
Gwen:
 I never interact with my coworkers, and I can’t 
imagine that the retreat will be interesting. I feel 
anxious when I am around my coworkers. I do not 
feel that I am a part of their group. I feel judged 
and scrutinized by them.
Gwen’s  faulty  assumptions  and  cognitive  distor-
tions  fuel  her  anxiety.  I  want  to  help  Gwen  recognize  
these  old  irrational  thoughts  and  learn  that  these  
thoughts  have  caused  her  anxiety.  “Awfulizing”  the  
upcoming social event leads to more anxiety and trig-
gers her desire to isolate herself. If Gwen can become 
more self-aware, she will be able to actively dispute her 
faulty beliefs.
Therapist: You are telling yourself that you will have a 
horrible time at the retreat. You think your cowork-
ers will judge you. What evidence do you have that 
they are judging you? Do you have any evidence that 
suggests one or several of your coworkers are not 
judging you? Imagine that you are holding a picture 
of the retreat and how you fit in at work. The frame 
is old and dusty. What would happen if you put a 
new frame on the picture? Can you reframe your 
thoughts about going to the retreat and interacting 
with your coworkers in a more positive way?
Gwen:
 Well, I don’t have to say it will be horrible. I 
guess that thought makes me dread it. I truthfully 
don’t know how it will go at all. Maybe I can tell 
myself to show up without judgment for a change 
and just see what happens. I get caught up in nega-
tive thinking sometimes.
Therapist: When you hear negative words in your 
mind or say them, allow yourself to cancel those 
thoughts. Dispute the negative statement, and 
replace it with a statement that supports how you 
want to feel and think about yourself. Tell me some 
of the cognitive distortions that keep you stuck in 
anxiety or negative feelings.
Gwen:
 I say to myself that the people at work are 
waiting for me to make a mistake, that I am differ-
ent, and that they don’t want to socialize with me. 
Actually, I haven’t really tried to get to know them.
Therapist: What can you do differently in the work-
place to foster relationships with your coworkers 
that might serve to reduce your anxiety?
Gwen: I guess I could say hello to my coworkers in-
stead of walking through the office ignoring them. 
I really do want to create positive relationships in 
the office and not feel like an outsider.
Therapist: And how will you respond to those nag-
ging thoughts that everyone is against you?
Gwen: I am beginning to realize that there is really no 
evidence to support feeling that I am being judged 
and scrutinized by my coworkers. Maybe I am quiet 
because I am afraid they will reject me, and so I 
reject them first.
Therapist: Let’s agree on some homework for this 
week. When you are feeling judged and scrutinized, 
see if you can counter the assumptions you are 
making by looking at the facts.
Gwen: Maybe I could make a list of my assumptions 
and some of the negative thoughts that result from 
them. Then I could try to list some facts that coun-
ter those negative thoughts.
Therapist: I am glad you are willing to try to find 
some facts to work with. I think this will help you 
to be less anxious.

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
REBT has evolved into a comprehensive and integrative approach that emphasizes 
thinking,  assessing,  deciding,  doing,  and  compassion.  This  approach  is  based  on  
the premise of the interconnectedness of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Therapy 
can begin with clients’ problematic behaviors and emotions, and clients can learn 
to dispute the thoughts that directly create them. To block any self-defeating beliefs 
that are reinforced by a process of self-indoctrination, REBT therapists employ active 
and  directive  techniques  such  as  teaching,  suggestion,  persuasion,  and  homework  
assignments, and they encourage clients to substitute a rational belief system for an 
irrational  one.  Therapists  demonstrate  how  and  why  dysfunctional  beliefs  lead  to  
negative  emotional  and  behavioral  results.  They  teach  clients  how  to  dispute  self-
defeating beliefs and behaviors that might occur in the future. REBT emphasizes the 
benefit of taking action—doing something about the insights one gains in therapy. 
Change comes about mainly by practicing new behaviors that replace old and inef-
fective  ones.  Unconditional  self-acceptance,  unconditional  other-acceptance,  and  
unconditional  life-acceptance  are  strongly  encouraged.  Rational  emotive  behavior  
therapists are typically eclectic in selecting therapeutic strategies. They have the lati-
tude to develop their own personal style and to exercise creativity; they are not bound 
by fixed techniques for particular problems.
Cognitive therapists also practice from an integrative stance, using many meth-
ods  to  help  clients  learn  to  identify  links  between  thoughts,  emotions,  behaviors,  
physiology,  and  situations.  Some  defining  characteristics  of  cognitive  therapy  are  
that  the  client  is  active  and  works  as  a  partner  with  the  therapist;  the  therapist  is  
active  and  directive;  the  therapy  is  structured  and  psychoeducational;  an  agenda  
provides  focus  for  each  session;  and  therapy  is  time  limited  (Freeman  &  Freeman,  
2016).  The  working  alliance  is  given  special  importance  in  cognitive  therapy  as  a  
way of forming a collaborative partnership. Although rapport in the client–therapist 
relationship is viewed as helpful by Beck, it is not considered sufficient for therapy

Gwen: And I will try to be more friendly at work.
Therapist: Isolating yourself doesn’t seem to be work-
ing, so let’s see how you feel when you talk with 
your coworkers.
I give Gwen a journal to record her homework ex-
periments  and  how  doing  a  new  behavior  affects  her  
anxiety level. I encourage her to develop awareness of 
the  automatic  thoughts  that  occur  to  her  so  she  can  
become  more  adept  at  catching  and  disputing  them.  
In  our  next  session,  we  discuss  her  homework  and  
evaluate the response it has had on her level of anxiety 
in the workplace.
Questions for Reflection
What role, if any, does Gwen play in her experi-
ences of isolation?
How does the therapist intervene to assist Gwen in 
looking for evidence for her negative thinking?
How would you encourage Gwen to complete her 
homework assignment?
How would you respond if you knew that Gwen 
was being subjected to racism and rejection in the 
office? How would CBT help her in that case?
What additional CBT technique might you use if 
you were counseling Gwen?

success.  In  cognitive  therapy,  it  is  presumed  that  clients  are  helped  by  the  skillful  
use  of  a  range  of  cognitive  and  behavioral  interventions  and  by  therapists  engag-
ing clients’ willingness to perform homework assignments between sessions. Ther-
apists  are  expected  to  be  able  to  conceptualize  client  problems  in  ways  that  link  
personal client experiences to the evidence-based treatments that are most likely to 
be successful.
All  of  the  cognitive  behavioral  approaches  stress  the  importance  of  links  
between cognitive processes, emotions, and behavior. It is assumed that how people 
feel and what they actually do is largely influenced by their subjective assessment and 
interpretation  of  situations.  Because  this  appraisal  of  life  situations  is  influenced  
by beliefs, attitudes, assumptions, and internal dialogue, such cognitions become a 
major focus of therapy.
Contributions of the Cognitive Behavioral Approaches
Most of the therapies discussed in this book can be considered “cognitive” 
in  a  general  sense  because  they  have  the  aim  of  changing  clients’  subjective  views  
of themselves and the world. The cognitive behavioral approaches have developed 
systematic and sophisticated forms of psychotherapy that focus on testing assump-
tions  and  beliefs  and  teaching  clients  the  coping  skills  needed  to  deal  with  their  
problems.  A  basic  principle  of  CBT  is  emotional  and  behavioral  changes  can  be  
achieved by changing cognitions, just as cognitive change can be altered by actions 
and emotions (Freeman & Freeman, 2016).
Ellis’s  REBT  and  Beck’s  CT  represent  the  most  systematic  applications  of  cog-
nitive  behavior  therapy.  Both  REBT  and  CT  are  based  on  a  wide  range  of  cognitive  
behavioral techniques and follow a defined plan of action; they can often be relatively 
brief and structured treatments in keeping with the spirit of maximizing effectiveness 
and efficiency, cost effectiveness, and evidence-based practice (Hollon & DiGiuseppe, 
2011). The psychoeducational aspect of CBT and REBT is a clear strength that can be 
applied to many clinical problems and used effectively in many settings with diverse 
client populations (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011). The evidence basis in support of CBT thera-
pies often makes them the “gold standard” by which therapy effectiveness is judged.
Ellis’s REBT One of the strengths of REBT is the focus on teaching clients ways to 
carry on their own therapy without the direct intervention of a therapist. I particularly 
like  the  emphasis  that  REBT  puts  on  supplementary  and  psychoeducational  
approaches  such  as  listening  to  tapes,  reading  self-help  books,  keeping  a  record  
of what they are doing and thinking, and carrying out homework assignments. In 
this way clients can further the process of change in themselves without becoming 
excessively dependent on a therapist.
Beck’s  Cognitive  Therapy  Beck’s  key  concepts  share  similarities  with  REBT  
but  differ  in  being  empirically  rather  than  philosophically  derived,  the  processes  
by  which  therapy  proceeds,  and  the  formulation  and  treatment  for  different  
disorders.  Beck  made  pioneering  efforts  in  the  treatment  of  anxiety,  phobias,  and  
depression.  Beck  demonstrated  that  a  structured  therapy  that  is  present  centered  
and problem oriented can be very effective in treating depression and anxiety in a

relatively short time. Today, empirically validated treatments for both anxiety and 
depression have revolutionized therapeutic practice; research has demonstrated the 
efficacy of cognitive therapy for a variety of problems (Leahy, 2002; Scher, Segal, & 
Ingram, 2006; Hofmann et al., 2012). Beck developed specific cognitive procedures 
to help depressive clients evaluate their assumptions and beliefs and to create a new 
cognitive  perspective  that  can  lead  to  optimism  and  changed  behavior.  Research  
demonstrates that the effects of cognitive therapy on depression and hopelessness 
are usually maintained for at least one year after treatment. Cognitive therapy has 
been  applied  to  a  wide  range  of  clinical  populations  that  Beck  did  not  originally  
believe  were  appropriate  for  this  model,  including  treatment  for  posttraumatic  
stress  disorder,  schizophrenia,  delusional  disorders,  bipolar  disorder,  and  various  
personality disorders (Hofmann et al., 2012). The credibility of the cognitive model 
grows out of the fact that many of its propositions have been empirically tested.
Padesky and Mooney’s Strengths-Based CBT Beck’s CT has been further expanded 
with   Padesky   and   Mooney’s   strengths-based   CBT   approach.   In   addition   to   
incorporating  strengths  at  each  phase  of  treatment,  SB-CBT  has  successfully  
incorporated  a  wide  range  of  modalities  including  imagery,  metaphor,  stories,  
and  kinesthetic  body  experiences  into  the  broad  repertoire  of  CBT  interventions.  
SB-CBT  also  provides  models  that  extend  CBT  from  evidence-based  treatment  of  
client  problems  to  evidence-based  models  for  developing  positive  qualities  and  
client strengths. Instead of focusing solely on testing existing beliefs, SB-CBT offers 
systematic  methods  for  helping  clients  construct  new  beliefs  and  behaviors  that  
help realize their goals of “how they would like to be.”
Meichenbaum’s Cognitive Behavior Modification Meichenbaum’s work in self-
instruction and stress inoculation training has been applied successfully to a variety 
of  client  populations  and  specific  problems.  Of  special  note  is  his  contribution  
to   understanding   how   stress   is   largely   self-induced   through   inner   dialogue.   
Meichenbaum’s integration of the cognitive narrative perspective is a key strength 
of his therapy style. He is able to combine elements of the postmodern interest in 
stories clients tell with assisting clients in changing their cognitions, feelings, and 
behaviors by drawing on a cognitive behavioral conceptual framework.
A  contribution  of  all  of  the  cognitive  behavioral  approaches  is  the  emphasis  on  
putting newly acquired insights into action. Homework assignments are well suited to 
enabling clients to practice new behaviors and assisting them in the process of learn-
ing more effective coping skills. It is important that collaboratively created homework 
be  a  natural  outgrowth  of  what  is  taking  place  in  the  therapy  session.  Ellis’s  REBT,  
Beck’s cognitive therapy, Padesky and Mooney’s strengths-based CBT, and Meichen-
baum’s stress inoculation training all place special emphasis on practicing new skills 
both in therapy and in daily life, and homework is a key part of the learning process. 
Clients learn how to generalize coping skills to various problem situations and acquire 
relapse prevention strategies to ensure that their gains are consolidated.
A  major  contribution  made  by  Ellis,  the  Becks,  Padesky  and  Mooney,  and  
Meichenbaum is the demystification of the therapy process. The cognitive behavioral

approaches  are  based  on  an  educational  model  that  stresses  a  working  alliance  
between therapist and client. The models encourage self-help, provide for continu-
ous feedback from the client on how well treatment strategies are working, and pro-
vide  a  structure  and  direction  to  the  therapy  process  that  allows  for  evaluation  of  
outcomes. Clients are active, informed, and responsible for the direction of therapy 
because they are partners in the enterprise.
Limitations and Criticisms of the Cognitive Behavioral Approaches
Some  critics  have  charged  that  the  cognitive  behavioral  approaches  focus  
only  limited  attention  on  the  role  of  emotions  in  treatment.  These  therapies  
were  originally  developed  to  help  people  already  experiencing  extreme  emotional  
arousal, and this perception may be an artifact of that fact. When clients are severely 
depressed or highly anxious, it is beneficial to focus less directly on these emotions 
per se and more on the balancing roles of belief and behavior. When CBT therapists 
work  with  clients  who  keep  emotion  at  arms’  length,  they  use  imagery,  role  play,  
and emotional expression to elicit emotion and bring it into therapy. Although CBT 
therapists may not talk about emotion as frequently as some other therapies, CBT is 
almost always dealing directly with emotion and its consequences. Some potential 
limitations of the various CBT approaches follow.
Ellis’s REBT I question the REBT assumption that exploring the past is ineffective 
in  helping  clients  change  faulty  thinking  and  behavior.  From  my  perspective,  
exploring  past  childhood  experiences  can  have  a  great  deal  of  therapeutic  power  
if  the  discussion  is  connected  to  present  functioning.  In  fact,  Albert  Ellis  would  
(and  Debbie  Joffe  Ellis  continues  to)  listen  to  past  childhood  experiences  in  the  
initial session, or during early sessions. These stories can be valuable as sources of 
irrational beliefs still held by the client in the here and now. Attention would then 
very quickly move to exploring, disputing, and replacing these beliefs.
Another  potential  limitation  involves  the  misuse  of  the  therapist’s  power  by  
imposing ideas of what constitutes rational thinking. Due to the active and direc-
tive  nature  of  this  approach,  it  is  particularly  important  for  practitioners  to  avoid  
imposing their own philosophy of life on their clients. The skillful REBT therapist 
clarifies the REBT definitions of rational versus irrational thoughts and healthy neg-
ative emotions versus unhealthy negative emotions (A. Ellis & Ellis, 2011).
Some clients may have trouble with a confrontational style of REBT, especially 
if  a  strong  therapeutic  alliance  has  not  been  established.  It  is  well  to  underscore  
that  REBT  can  be  effective  when  practiced  in  a  style  different  from  Ellis’s.  Albert  
Ellis often expressed that therapists do not need to emulate his style to effectively 
incorporate  REBT  into  their  own  repertoire  of  interventions.  Debbie  Joffe  Ellis,  
who continues to teach and write about the “Ellis” REBT approach, enthusiastically 
encourages therapists to adhere to REBT tenets and principles in their own authen-
tic manner and style (D. Ellis, 2014).
Beck’s  Cognitive  Therapy  Cognitive  therapy  has  been  criticized  for  focusing  
too  much  on  the  power  of  positive  thinking;  being  too  superficial  and  simplistic;  
denying the importance of the client’s past; being too technique oriented; failing to

use the therapeutic relationship; working only on eliminating symptoms, but failing 
to  explore  the  underlying  causes  of  difficulties;  ignoring  the  role  of  unconscious  
factors; and neglecting the role of feelings (Freeman & Dattilio, 1992; Weishaar, 1993).
Although the cognitive therapist is straightforward and looks for simple rather 
than complex solutions, this does not imply that the practice of cognitive therapy 
is simple. Cognitive therapists do not pursue positive thinking but rather thinking 
based on actual experiences. Cognitive therapists do not believe the unconscious is 
difficult to access. With direct and guided questioning, clients can identify assump-
tions and beliefs that exist below awareness and also link these beliefs to behavioral 
patterns and emotional reactions. They also recognize that clients’ current problems 
are often a product of earlier life experiences, and they may explore with clients the 
ways their past is presently influencing them.
Padesky and Mooney’s Strengths-Based CBT The biggest criticism of strengths-
based CBT is that the evidence base supporting the approach is still in its infancy. Some 
CBT therapists question whether the addition of client strengths adds anything to 
CBT’s effectiveness. Studies currently under way in Europe and the United Kingdom 
are testing this hypothesis, especially to see whether a strengths and resilience focus 
increases  the  enduring  effects  of  therapy.  Further  research  is  necessary  to  examine  
whether construction of new beliefs and behaviors is more effective than examining 
current beliefs and behaviors in the treatment of chronic problems.
Meichenbaum’s Cognitive Behavior Modification Meichenbaum is very charismatic 
in his workshop presentations. Much of the success of his approach may be based on 
his level of caring and his creativity in implementing CBT interventions. Practitioners 
without  his  wit,  energy,  personal  flair,  and  direct  therapeutic  style  may  not  get  the  
same  results  even  though  they  follow  his  treatment  protocol.  This  emphasizes  the  
importance for each therapist to develop his or her own unique therapeutic style.
A potential limitation of any of the cognitive behavioral approaches is the thera-
pist’s  level  of  personal  development,  training,  knowledge,  skill,  perceptiveness,  and  
ability  to  establish  a  therapeutic  alliance.  Although  this  is  true  of  all  therapeutic  
approaches, it is especially true for CBT practitioners because they tend to be active, 
highly structured, offer clients useful information, and teach life skills. Who the ther-
apist  is  as  a  person  is  as  important  as  knowledge  and  skills.  Therapists  teach  their  
clients through what they model. Debbie Joffe Ellis (2014) encourages practitioners 
to strive to be mindful, to think about their thinking, and to do their best to practice 
what they preach. In so doing, they can be healthy models for their clients and others 
and experience greater authenticity and satisfaction in their own lives as well.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. In most CBT models, the therapist functions in many ways as a 
teacher. How does a psychoeducational model fit with your way of 
practicing counseling?
2. Cognitive behavioral practitioners use a brief, active, directive, collab-
orative, present-focused, didactic, psychoeducational model of therapy

ROBERT E. WUBBOLDING (b. 1936), born and raised 
in  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  is  the  youngest  of  six  children.  
He received his doctorate in counseling from the Uni-
versity  of  Cincinnati,  is  a  member  of  several  profes-
sional organizations, and has licenses as a counselor 
and as a psychologist. He taught high school history, 
worked as a high school and elementary school coun-
selor, and served as a consultant to drug and alcohol 
abuse programs of the U.S. Army and Air Force. Wub-
bolding began a career in the Catholic priesthood but 
later “left the clergy freely and honorably.” He is mar-
ried to Sandra Trifilio, a former French teacher, who 
WILLIAM  GLASSER  (1925—2013)  was  
educated  at  Case  Western  Reserve  Uni-
versity  in  Cleveland,  Ohio.  Initially  a  
chemical engineer, he turned to psychol-
ogy (MA, Clinical Psychology, 1948) and 
then  to  psychiatry,  attending  medical  
school (MD, 1953) with the intention of 
becoming a psychiatrist. By 1957 he had 
completed  his  psychiatric  training  at  
the Veterans Administration and UCLA 
in  Los  Angeles  and  in  1961  was  board  
certified in psychiatry. Glasser was mar-
ried to Naomi for 47 years, and she was 
very involved with the William Glasser Institute until 
her  death  in  1992.  In  1995  Glasser  married  Carleen,  
who is an instructor at the institute and coauthor of 
several of his books.
Very  early  Glasser  rejected  the  Freudian  model,  
partly  due  to  his  observation  of  psychoanalytically  
trained  therapists  who  did  not  seem  to  be  imple-
menting  Freudian  principles.  Rather,  they  tended  to  
hold  people  responsible  for  their  behavior.  Early  in  
his  career,  Glasser  was  a  psychiatrist  at  the  Ventura  
School, a prison and school for girls operated by the 
California  Youth  Authority.  He  became  convinced  
that  his  psychoanalytic  training  was  of  limited  util-
ity  in  counseling  these  young  people.  From  these  
observations,  Glasser  thought  it  best  to  talk  to  the  
sane part of clients, not their disturbed side. Glasser 
was  also  influenced  by  G.  L.  Harrington,  a  psychia-
trist  and  mentor.  Harrington  believed  in  getting  his  
patients involved in projects in the real world, and by 
the end of his residency Glasser began to put together 
ideas that would later be known as reality therapy.
In 1962 Glasser began to present public lectures 
on  “reality  psychiatry,”  but  few  psychiatrists  were  
in  the  audience.  Most  of  those  attending  were  edu-
cators,  social  workers,  counselors,  and  correctional  
workers,  so  Glasser  changed  the  name  of  his  system  
to  “reality  therapy,”  which  became  the  title  of  his  
groundbreaking book published in 1965. 
Educators  found  the  principles  of  real-
ity  therapy  helpful,  and  he  was  asked  to  
apply it to the classroom and the school 
as  an  organization.  As  a  result  of  this  
experience,  he  wrote  Schools  Without  Fail-
ure in 1968, which had a major impact on 
the administration of schools, the train-
ing  of  teachers,  and  the  way  learning  is  
conducted  in  schools.  Glasser  took  the  
position that schools needed to be struc-
tured  in  ways  to  help  students  achieve  
a success  identity  as  opposed  to  a  failure 
identity. He advocated for a curriculum geared to the 
lives  of  learners.  Glasser  made  significant  contribu-
tions  through  in-service  workshops  for  teachers  and  
administrators.  Since  the  late  1960s,  reality  therapy  
has  been  further  applied  to  education  and  to  virtu-
ally all other human relationships, especially intimate 
relationships. Most recently, reality therapy has been 
applied  to  management  and  supervision,  coaching,  
family  therapy,  and  parenting.  It  is  now  taught  and  
embedded on every continent except Antarctica.
Glasser  became  convinced  that  it  was  of  para-
mount   importance   that   clients   accept   personal   
responsibility  for  their  behavior.  By  the  early  1980s,  
Glasser  was  looking  for  a  theory  that  could  explain  
all his work. Glasser learned about control theory from 
William Powers, and he believed this theory had great 
potential.  He  spent  the  next  10  years  expanding,  
revising,  and  clarifying  what  he  was  initially  taught.  
By  1996  Glasser  had  become  convinced  that  these  
revisions  had  so  changed  the  theory  that  it  was  mis-
leading  to  continue  to  call  it  control  theory,  and  he  
changed the name to choice theory to reflect all that he 
had  developed.  The  essence  of  reality  therapy,  now  
taught all over the world, is that we are all responsible 
for what we choose to do. We are internally motivated 
by current needs and wants, and we control our pres-
ent behavioral choices.

Introduction
Reality  therapists  believe  the  underlying  problem  for  most  clients  is  the  
same:  they  are  either  involved  in  a  present  unsatisfying  relationship  or  lack  what  
could even be called a relationship. Many client problems are caused by their inabil-
ity to connect, to get close to others, or to have a satisfying or successful relation-
ship  with  at  least  one  significant  person  in  their  life.  The  therapist  guides  clients  
toward a satisfying relationship and teaches them more effective ways of behaving. 
The  more  clients  are  able  to  connect  with  people,  the  greater  chance  they  have  to  
experience happiness.
Few clients understand that their problem, which is unhappiness, results from 
the  way  they  are  choosing  to  behave.  What  they  do  know  is  that  they  feel  a  great  
deal of pain or that they are unhappy because they have been sent for counseling by 
someone  with  authority  who  is  not  satisfied  with  their  behavior—typically  a  court  
official, a school administrator, an employer, a spouse, or a parent. Reality therapists 
recognize that clients choose their behaviors as a way to deal with the frustrations 
caused by unsatisfying relationships.
Glasser  (2003)  maintained  that  clients  should  not  be  labeled  with  a  diagnosis  
except when it is necessary for insurance purposes. From Glasser’s perspective, diag-
noses are descriptions of the behaviors people choose in their attempt to deal with 
LO1
shares  his  passion  for  his  work  and  is  
administrator  of  the  Center  for  Reality  
Therapy and editor of his writings.
Wubbolding  is  now  the  director  of  
the  Center  for  Reality  Therapy  in  Cin-
cinnati  and  faculty  associate  at  Johns  
Hopkins University. He is also professor 
emeritus  of  Xavier  University,  where  he  
taught counselor education for 32 years. 
He  loved  teaching  and  viewed  his  stu-
dents  as  being  highly  motivated,  eager  
to  learn,  and  experienced.  One  of  his  
most meaningful experiences was teach-
ing  graduate  students  in  the  counseling  department  
at Xavier University.
After   completing   his   doctorate,   Wubbolding   
attended training sessions representing a wide range 
of  counseling  approaches,  yet  he  found  reality  ther-
apy  to  be  best  suited  to  his  interests.  He  attended  
many  intensive  training  workshops  conducted  by  
William  Glasser  in  Los  Angeles,  and  in  1988  Glasser  
appointed  him  director  of  training  for  the  William  
Glasser Institute.
Wubbolding  served  as  visiting  professor  at  the  
University  of  Southern  California  in  their  overseas  
programs  in  Japan,  Korea,  and  Germany,  
thus  fulfilling  his  lifelong  desire  to  travel  
and   to   live   in   other   countries.   He   has   
become an internationally known teacher, 
author,  and  practitioner  of  reality  therapy  
and has introduced choice theory and real-
ity therapy in Europe, Asia, and the Middle 
East.  Among  his  specialties  is  adapting  
choice theory and reality therapy to various 
cultures  and  ethnic  groups.  He  received  
the  Gratitude  Award  (2009)  for  Initiating  
Reality  Therapy  in  the  United  Kingdom  
and the Certificate of Reality Therapy Psy-
chotherapist by the European Association for Psycho-
therapy (2009).
Wubbolding  extended  the  theory  and  practice  
of  reality  therapy  with  his  conceptualization  of  the  
WDEP  system.  He  has  written  14  books  and  more  
than 150 articles, essays, and chapters in textbooks as 
well as preparing more than 20 DVDs, some of which 
are  referenced  in  this  chapter.  His  religious  commit-
ment and his life of service to others are apparent in 
his  work,  and  he  continues  his  vocation  of  teacher,  
counselor,  psychologist,  and  active  member  of  his  
church.

the pain and frustration that is endemic to their unsatisfying present relationships. 
Labeling these ineffective behaviors as mental illness is inaccurate. Glasser limits the 
term mental illness to conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, head trauma, 
and  brain  infections—conditions  associated  with  tangible  brain  damage.  Because  
these  people  are  suffering  from  a  brain  abnormality,  Glasser’s  view  is  that  they  
should be treated primarily by neurologists. Wubbolding tempers these principles, 
advising counselors to follow standard practice and the standard of care regarding 
diagnosis and use of psychiatric medications.
Reality therapy is based on choice theory as it is explained in several of Glasser’s 
(1998, 2001, 2003) books. (In this chapter, the discussion of Glasser’s ideas pertains 
to  these  three  books,  unless  otherwise  specified.)  
choice  theory  is  the  theoretical  
basis for reality therapy; it explains why and how we function. reality therapy pro-
vides  a  delivery  system  for  helping  individuals  take  more  effective  control  of  their  
lives. If choice theory is the highway, reality therapy is the vehicle delivering the prod-
uct (Wubbolding, 2011a). Therapy consists mainly of helping and sometimes teach-
ing clients to make more effective choices as they deal with the people they need in 
their lives. It is essential for the therapist to establish a satisfying relationship with 
clients as a prerequisite for effective therapy. Once this relationship is developed, the 
skill of the therapist as listener and teacher assumes a central role.
Reality therapy has been used in a variety of settings. The approach is applicable 
to counseling, social work, education, crisis intervention, corrections and rehabili-
tation, institutional management, and community development. Reality therapy is 
popular in schools, state mental health hospitals, halfway houses, and alcohol and 
drug  abuse  centers.  Many  of  the  military  clinics  that  treat  substance  abusers  use  
reality therapy as their preferred therapeutic approach.

Key Concepts
View of Human Nature
choice theory posits that we are not born blank slates waiting to be externally 
motivated by forces in the world around us. Rather, we are born with five genetically 
encoded needs that drive us all our lives: survival, or self-preservation; love and belong-
ing; power, or inner control; freedom, or independence; and fun, or enjoyment. Each of 
us has all five needs, but they vary in strength. For example, we all have a need for love 
and belonging, but some of us need more love than others. Choice theory is based 
on the premise that because we are by nature social creatures we need to both receive 
and give love. Glasser (2001, 2005) believes the need to love and to belong is the primary 
need because we need people to satisfy the other needs. It is also the most difficult 
need to satisfy because we must have a cooperative person to help us meet it.
Our brain functions as a control system. It continually monitors our feelings to 
determine how well we are doing in our lifelong effort to satisfy these needs. When-
ever we feel bad, one or more of these five needs is unsatisfied. Although we may not

be aware of our needs, we know that we want to feel better. Driven by pain, we try to 
figure out how to feel better. Reality therapists teach clients choice theory, sometimes 
subtly and indirectly, so clients can identify unmet needs and try to satisfy them.
Choice  theory  teaches  that  we  do  not  satisfy  our  needs  directly.  Beginning  
shortly after birth and continuing all our lives, we keep close track of anything we 
do that feels very good. We store information inside our minds and build a file of 
wants,  called  our  quality  world,  which  is  at  the  core  of  our  life.  It  is  our  personal  
Shangri-la—the world we would like to live in if we could. It is completely based on 
our wants and needs, but unlike the needs, which are general, it is very specific. The 
quality world consists of specific images of people, activities, events, beliefs, posses-
sions, and situations that fulfill our needs (Wubbolding, 2000, 2011a). In our qual-
ity world we develop an inner picture album of specific wants as well as precise ways 
to satisfy these wants. We are attempting to behave in a way that gives us the most 
effective  control  over  our  lives.  Some  pictures  may  be  blurred,  and  the  therapist’s  
role is to help the client clarify them. Pictures exist in priority for most people, yet 
clients may have difficulty identifying their priorities. Part of the process of reality 
therapy is assisting clients in prioritizing their wants and uncovering what is most 
important to them (Wubbolding, 2011a).
People we are closest to and most enjoy being with are the most important com-
ponent of our quality world, and we most want to connect with these people. Those 
who enter therapy may have no one in their quality world or, more often, may have 
someone  in  their  quality  world  whom  they  are  unable  to  relate  to  in  a  satisfying  
way. For therapy to have a chance of success, a therapist must be the kind of person 
that clients would consider putting in their quality world. Getting into the clients’ 
quality world is the art of therapy. It is from this relationship with the therapist that 
clients begin to learn how to get close to the people they need.
Choice Theory Explanation of Behavior
Choice theory explains that all we ever do from birth to death is behave, and, 
with some exceptions, everything we do is chosen or at least generated from within 
ourselves. Every total behavior is our best attempt to get what we want to satisfy our 
needs. 
total behavior teaches that all behavior is made up of four inseparable but 
distinct components—acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology—that necessarily accom-
pany  all  of  our  actions,  thoughts,  and  feelings.  Choice  theory  emphasizes  think-
ing and acting, which makes this a general form of cognitive behavior therapy. The 
primary  emphasis  is  on  what  the  client  is  doing  and  how  the  doing  component  
influences the other aspects of total behavior. Behavior is purposeful because it is 
designed to close the gap between what we want and what we perceive we are get-
ting. Specific behaviors are always generated from this discrepancy. Our behaviors 
come from the inside, and thus we choose our destiny.
From  Glasser’s  perspective,  to  speak  of  being  depressed,  having  a  headache,  
being angry, or being anxious implies passivity and lack of personal responsibility, 
and it is inaccurate. It is more accurate to think of these as parts of total behaviors 
and  to  use  the  verb  forms  depressing,  headaching,  angering,  and  anxietying  to  describe  
them.  It  is  more  accurate  to  think  of  people  depressing  or  angering  themselves  
rather than having the behaviors thrust upon them from the outside world. When

people  choose  misery  by  developing  a  range  of  “paining”  behaviors,  it  is  because  
these are the best behaviors they are able to devise at the time, and these behaviors 
often get them what they want.
When a reality therapist starts teaching choice theory, the client will often pro-
test and say, “I’m suffering, don’t tell me I’m choosing to suffer like this.” As painful 
as depressing is, the therapist explains that people do not choose pain and suffering 
directly;  rather,  it  is  an  unchosen  part  of  their  total  behavior.  The  behavior  of  the  
person is the best effort, ineffective as it is, to satisfy needs.
Robert Wubbolding (personal communication, April 4, 2015) has added a new 
idea to choice theory. He believes that behavior is a language and that we send mes-
sages by what we are doing. The purpose of behavior is to influence the world to get 
what we want. Therapists ask clients what messages they are sending to the world 
by way of their actions: “What message do you want others to get?” “What message 
are others getting whether or not you intended to send them?” By considering the 
messages clients send to others, counselors can help clients indirectly gain a greater 
appreciation of messages they unintentionally send to others.
Characteristics of Reality Therapy
The role of meaningful relationships in fostering emotional health is receiv-
ing increased attention in contemporary reality therapy, which quickly focuses on 
the unsatisfying relationship or the lack of a relationship. Clients may complain of 
not being able to keep a job, not doing well in school, or not having a meaningful 
relationship. When clients complain about how other people are causing them pain, 
reality therapists ask clients to consider how effective their choices are, especially as 
these choices affect their relationships with significant people in their lives. Choice 
theory teaches that talking about what clients cannot control is of minimal value; 
the emphasis is on what clients can control in their relationships. The basic axiom 
of choice theory, which is crucial for clients to understand, is that “the only person 
you can control is yourself.”
Reality therapists spend little time listening to complaining, blaming, and crit-
icizing,  for  these  are  the  most  ineffective  behaviors  in  our  behavioral  repertoire.  
What  do  reality  therapists  focus  on?  Here  are  some  underlying  characteristics  of  
reality therapy.
Emphasize  Choice  and  Responsibility  Reality  therapists  see  clients  as  being  
responsible for their own choices as they have more control of their behavior than 
they  often  believe.  This  does  not  mean  people  should  be  blamed  or  punished,  
unless they break the law, but it does mean the therapist never loses sight of the fact 
that  clients  are  responsible  for  what  they  do.  Choice  theory  changes  the  focus  of  
responsibility to choice and choosing.
Reality therapists deal with people “as if ” they have choices. Therapists focus 
on those areas where clients have choice, for doing so gets them closer to the peo-
ple they need. For example, being involved in meaningful activities, such as work, 
is a good way to gain the respect of other people, and work can help clients fulfill 
their  need  for  power.  It  is  very  difficult  for  adults  to  feel  good  about  themselves  
if they don’t engage in some form of meaningful activity. As clients begin to feel

good about themselves, it is less necessary for them to continue to choose ineffec-
tive and self-destructive behaviors.
Reject Transference Reality therapists strive to be themselves in their professional 
work. By being themselves, therapists can use the relationship to teach clients how 
to  relate  to  others  in  their  lives.  Glasser  contends  that  transference  is  a  way  that  
both therapist and client avoid being who they are and owning what they are doing 
right  now.  It  is  unrealistic  for  therapists  to  go  along  with  the  idea  that  they  are  
anyone but themselves. Assume the client claims, “I see you as my father or mother 
and this is why I’m behaving the way I am.” In such a situation a reality therapist is 
likely to say clearly and firmly, “I am not your mother, father, or anyone but myself.” 
Wubbolding (personal communication, April 4, 2015) states that he discusses this 
issue with clients in a detailed manner.
Keep  the  Therapy  in  the  Present  Some  clients  come  to  counseling  convinced  
that  they  must  revisit  the  past  if  they  are  to  be  helped.  Many  therapeutic  models  
teach that to function well in the present people must understand and revisit their 
past.  Glasser  (2001)  disagrees  with  this  assumption  and  contends  that  whatever  
mistakes were made in the past are not pertinent now. An axiom of choice theory is 
that the past may have contributed to a current problem but that the past is never 
the problem. To function effectively, people need to live and plan in the present and 
take steps to create a better future. We can only satisfy our needs in the present.
The reality therapist does not totally reject the past. If the client wants to talk 
about past successes or good relationships in the past, the therapist will listen because 
these may be repeated in the present. Reality therapists will devote only enough time 
to  past  failures  to  assure  clients  that  they  are  not  rejecting  them.  As  soon  as  pos-
sible,  therapists  tell  clients,  “What  has  happened  is  over;  it  can’t  be  changed.  The  
more time we spend looking back, the more we avoid looking forward.” Wubbolding 
states, “history is not destiny” (personal communication, April 4, 2015). Although 
the past has propelled us to the present, it does not have to determine our future. We 
are free to make choices, even though our external world limits our choices (Wub-
bolding, 2011b).
Avoid Focusing on Symptoms In traditional therapy a great deal of time is spent 
focusing on symptoms by asking clients how they feel and why they are obsessing. 
Focusing  on  the  past  “protects”  clients  from  facing  the  reality  of  unsatisfying  
present  relationships,  and  focusing  on  symptoms  does  the  same  thing.  Whether  
people are depressing or paining, they tend to think that what they are experiencing 
is happening to them. They are reluctant to accept the reality that their suffering is 
due to the total behavior they are choosing. Their symptoms can be viewed as the 
body’s  way  of  warning  them  that  the  behavior  they  are  choosing  is  not  satisfying  
their basic needs. The reality therapist spends as little time as he or she can on the 
symptoms  because  they  will  last  only  as  long  as  they  are  needed  to  deal  with  an  
unsatisfying relationship or the frustration of basic needs.
According  to  Glasser,  if  clients  believe  that  the  therapist  wants  to  hear  about  
their symptoms or spend time talking about the past, they are more than willing to 
comply. Engaging in long journeys into the past or exploring symptoms results in

lengthy therapy. Glasser (2005) maintains that almost all symptoms are caused by a 
present unhappy relationship. By focusing on present problems, especially interper-
sonal concerns, therapy can generally be shortened considerably.
Challenge  Traditional  Views  of  Mental  Illness  Choice  theory  rejects  the  
traditional   notion   that   people   with   problematic   physical   and   psychological   
symptoms  are  mentally  ill.  Wubbolding  (personal  communication,  April  4,  2015)  
takes  a  firm  stand  on  using  the  DSM-5  in  creative  ways  and  adhering  to  standard  
practice, which includes diagnosing mental disorders. Glasser (2003), however, has 
warned people to be cautious of psychiatry, which can be hazardous to both one’s 
physical and mental health. He criticizes the traditional psychiatric establishment 
for relying heavily on the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for both 
diagnosis and treatment. Glasser (2003) challenges the traditionally accepted views 
of mental illness and treatment by the use of medication, especially the widespread 
use of psychiatric drugs that often results in negative side effects both physically and 
psychologically. Wubbolding (personal communication, April 4, 2015) emphasizes 
that reality therapy is a mental health system rather than a remediating system. He 
incorporates the Ericksonian principle that “people don’t have problems, they have 
solutions  that  have  not  worked.”  By  reframing  diagnostic  categories  and  negative  
behaviors,  the  counselor  helps  clients  perceive  their  behaviors  in  a  very  different  
light, which facilitates the search for more effective solutions and choices.
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
A primary goal of contemporary reality therapy is to help clients get connected or recon-
nected  with  the  people  they  have  chosen  to  put  in  their  quality  world.  In  addition  to  
fulfilling this need for love and belonging, a basic goal of reality therapy is to help clients 
learn  better  ways  of  fulfilling  all  of  their  needs,  including  achievement,  power  or  inner  
control, freedom or independence, and fun. The basic human needs serve to focus treat-
ment planning and setting both short- and long-term goals. Reality therapists assist cli-
ents in making more effective and responsible choices related to their wants and needs.
In many instances, clients come voluntarily for therapy, and these clients are the 
easiest  to  help.  However,  another  goal  entails  working  with  an  increasing  number  
of involuntary clients who may actively resist the therapist and the therapy process. 
These individuals often engage in violent behavior, addictions, and other kinds of 
antisocial behaviors. It is essential for counselors to do whatever they can to connect 
with involuntary clients. If the counselor is unable to make a connection, there is no 
possibility of providing significant help. If the counselor can make a connection, the 
goal of teaching the client how to fulfill his or her needs can slowly begin.
Therapist’s Function and Role
Therapy  is  often  considered  as  a  mentoring  process  in  which  the  therapist  
is the teacher and the client is the student. Reality therapists teach clients how to 
engage  in  self-evaluation,  which  is  done  by  raising  the  question,  “Is  what  you  are

choosing  to  do  getting  you  what  you  want  and  need?”  Here  are  some  other  ques-
tions that therapists tend to ask clients:
How would you most like to change your life?
What do you want in your life that you are not getting?
What would you have in your life if you were to change?
What do you have to do now to make the changes happen?
The role of the reality therapist is not to make the evaluation for clients but to 
challenge  clients  to  examine  what  they  are  doing.  Reality  therapists  assist  clients  
in  evaluating  their  own  behavioral  direction,  specific  actions,  wants,  perceptions,  
level of commitment, possibilities for new directions, and action plans. Clients then 
decide  what  to  change  and  formulate  a  plan  to  facilitate  the  desired  changes.  The  
outcome  is  better  relationships,  increased  happiness,  and  a  sense  of  inner  control  
over their life (Wubbolding, 2011b).
It is the job of therapists to convey the idea that no matter how bad things are 
there is hope. If therapists are able to instill this sense of hope, clients feel that they 
are no longer alone and that change is possible. The therapist functions as an advo-
cate, someone who is on the client’s side. Together they creatively address a range of 
concerns and options.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
Clients are not expected to backtrack into the past or get sidetracked into talking 
about symptoms. Neither will much time be spent talking about feelings separate 
from the acting and thinking that are part of the total behaviors over which clients 
have direct control. The emphasis is on actions. When clients change what they are 
doing, they often change how they are feeling and thinking.
Reality therapists will gently, but firmly challenge clients. They often ask clients 
questions such as these: “Is what you are choosing to do bringing you closer to the 
people you want to be closer to right now?” “Is what you are doing getting you closer 
to a new person if you are presently disconnected from everyone?” These questions 
are part of the self-evaluation process, which is the cornerstone of reality therapy.
Clients can expect to experience some urgency in therapy. Time is important, as 
each session may be the last. Clients should be able to say to themselves, “I can begin 
to use what we talked about today in my life. I am able to bring my present experi-
ences to therapy as my problems are in the present, and my therapist will not let me 
escape from that fact.”
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Reality therapy emphasizes an understanding and supportive relationship, or thera-
peutic alliance, which is the foundation for effective outcomes. The therapist’s skill 
in establishing a trusting relationship is critical. It is also important that the client 
perceives the therapist as being skilled and knowledgeable. Although the therapeu-
tic relationship is paramount, it is not an end in itself, and it is not automatically 
curative or healing (Wubbolding, 2011a).
For  involvement  between  the  therapist  and  the  client  to  occur,  the  counselor  
must  have  certain  personal  qualities,  including  warmth,  sincerity,  congruence,

understanding, acceptance, concern, respect for the client, openness, and the willing-
ness  to  be  challenged  by  others.  (For  other  personal  characteristics,  see  Chapter  2.)  
Wubbolding (2011a, 2011b; 2015a) identifies specific ways for counselors to create 
a  climate  that  leads  to  involvement  with  clients.  Some  of  these  ways  entail  using  
attending  behavior,  listening  to  clients,  suspending  judgment,  doing  the  unex-
pected, using humor appropriately, being oneself as a counselor, engaging in facili-
tative self-disclosure, listening for metaphors in the client’s mode of self-expression, 
listening  for  themes,  summarizing  and  focusing,  allowing  consequences,  allowing  
silence,  and  being  an  ethical  practitioner.  For  therapeutic  interventions  to  work  
effectively, a fair, firm, friendly, and trusting environment is necessary. Once involve-
ment has been established, the counselor assists clients in gaining a deeper under-
standing of the consequences of their current behavior.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The Practice of Reality Therapy
The practice of reality therapy can best be conceptualized as the cycle of coun-
seling (Wubbolding, 2015a), which consists of two major components: (1) creating 
the counseling environment and (2) implementing specific procedures that lead to 
changes in behavior. The art of counseling is to weave these components together 
in ways that lead clients to evaluate their lives and decide to move in more effective 
directions.
How  do  these  components  blend  in  the  counseling  process?  The  cycle  of  
counseling  begins  with  creating  a  working  relationship  with  clients  and  proceeds  
through  an  exploration  of  clients’  wants,  needs,  and  perceptions.  Clients  explore  
their total behavior and make their own evaluation of how effective they are in get-
ting what they want. If clients decide to try new behavior, they make plans that will 
lead to change, and they commit themselves to those plans. The cycle of counseling 
includes following up on how well clients are doing and offering further consulta-
tion as needed.
The concepts of reality therapy may seem simple as they are presented here, but 
being able to translate these principles into therapeutic practice takes considerable 
skill and creativity (Wubbolding, 2007, 2011b). All certified reality therapy counsel-
ors are grounded in the same principles, but the manner in which these principles are 
applied varies depending on the counselor’s style and personal characteristics. These 
principles are applied in a progressive manner, but they should not be thought of as 
discrete and rigid categories. The art of practicing reality therapy involves far more 
than following procedures in a step-by-step, cookbook fashion. With choice theory 
in the background of practice, the counselor tailors the counseling to what each cli-
ent presents. Although the counselor is prepared to work in a way that is meaningful 
to the client, the move toward satisfying relationships remains in the foreground.
Wubbolding has played a major role in the development of reality therapy and 
has extended the practice of reality therapy through development of the WDEP sys-
tem  (Wubbolding,  2009).  I  especially  value  Wubbolding’s  contributions  to  teach-
ing reality therapy and to conceptualizing therapeutic procedures. His ideas render 
choice  theory  practical  and  useable  by  counselors,  and  his  system  provides  a  basis

for conceptualizing and applying the theory. The Student Manual that accompanies 
this  textbook  contains  Wubbolding’s  (2015a)  chart,  which  diagrams  the  WDEP  
model. It describes coaching, managing, supervising, and parenting and highlights 
issues and tasks to be accomplished throughout the cycle of counseling. The follow-
ing sections are based on material from various sources (Glasser, 1992, 1998, 2001; 
Wubbolding, 1988, 1991, 2000, 2007, 2011a, 2011b, 2013, 2015a; 2015c; Wubbold-
ing et al., 1998, 2004).
The Counseling Environment
The practice of reality therapy rests on the assumption that a supportive and chal-
lenging  environment  allows  clients  to  begin  making  life  changes.  The  therapeutic  
relationship is the foundation for effective practice; if this is lacking, there is little 
hope that the system can be successfully implemented. Counselors who hope to cre-
ate  a  therapeutic  alliance  strive  to  avoid  arguing,  attacking,  accusing,  demeaning,  
blaming, bossing, criticizing, finding fault, coercing, encouraging excuses, holding 
grudges, instilling fear, or giving up easily (Wubbolding, 2011a, 2011b, 2015a). In 
a  short  period  of  time,  clients  generally  begin  to  appreciate  the  caring,  accepting,  
noncoercive choice theory environment. It is from this mildly confrontive yet always 
caring environment that clients learn to create the satisfying environment that leads 
to successful relationships. In this coercion-free atmosphere, clients feel free to be 
creative and to begin to try new behaviors.
Procedures That Lead to Change
Reality  therapists  operate  on  the  assumption  that  we  are  motivated  to  change  
(1) when we are convinced that our present behavior is not meeting our needs and 
(2)  when  we  believe  we  can  choose  other  behaviors  that  will  get  us  closer  to  what  
we  want.  Reality  therapists  begin  by  asking  clients  what  they  want  from  therapy.  
Therapists  take  the  mystery  and  uncertainty  out  of  the  therapeutic  process.  They  
also inquire about the choices clients are making in their relationships.
In the first session a skilled therapist looks for and defines the wants of the client. 
The  therapist  also  looks  for  a  key  unsatisfying  present  relationship—usually  with  a  
spouse, a child, a parent, or an employer. The therapist might ask, “Whose behavior 
can you control?” This question may need to be asked several times during the next 
few sessions to deal with the client’s resistance to looking at his or her own behavior. 
The emphasis is on encouraging the client to focus on what he or she can control.
When clients begin to realize that they can control only their own behavior, ther-
apy is under way. The rest of therapy focuses on how clients can make better choices. 
There are more choices available than clients realize, and the therapist explores these 
possible  choices.  Clients  may  be  stuck  in  misery,  blaming,  and  the  past,  but  they  
can choose to change—even if the other person in the relationship does not change. 
Wubbolding (2011a) points out that clients can learn they are not at the mercy of 
others,  are  not  victims,  are  capable  of  gaining  a  sense  of  inner  control,  and  have  a  
range  of  choices  open  to  them.  In  short,  clients  in  reality  therapy  often  acquire  a  
sense of hope for a better future.
Reality therapists explore the tenets of choice theory with clients, helping them 
identify  basic  needs,  discovering  their  quality  world,  and,  finally,  helping  clients

understand that they are choosing the total behaviors that are their symptoms. In 
every  instance  when  clients  make  a  change,  it  is  their  choice.  With  the  therapist’s  
help, clients learn to make better choices than they did when they were on their own. 
Through choice theory, clients can acquire and maintain successful relationships.
The “WDEP” System
Wubbolding (2000, 2015a, 2015c) uses the acronym WDEP to describe key proce-
dures in the practice of reality therapy. The WDEP system can be used to help clients 
explore their wants, possible things they can do, opportunities for self-evaluation, and 
design plans  for  improvement  (Wubbolding,  2007,  2011a,  2011b,  2015b,  2015c).  
Grounded in choice theory, the WDEP system assists people in satisfying their basic 
needs.  Each  of  the  letters  refers  to  a  cluster  of  strategies:  W  =  wants,  needs,  and  
perceptions; D = direction and doing; E = self-evaluation; and P = planning. These 
strategies are designed to promote change. Let’s look at each one in more detail.
Wants  (Exploring  Wants,  Needs,  and  Perceptions)  Reality  therapists  assist  
clients in discovering their wants and hopes. All wants are related to the five basic 
needs.  The  key  question  asked  is,  “What  do  you  want?”  Through  the  therapist’s  
skillful  questioning,  clients  are  assisted  in  defining  what  they  want  from  the  
counseling  process  and  from  the  world  around  them.  It  is  useful  for  clients  to  
define what they expect and want from the counselor and from themselves. Part of 
counseling  consists  of  exploring  the  “picture  album,”  or  quality  world,  of  clients  
and  how  their  behavior  is  aimed  at  moving  their  perception  of  the  external  world  
closer to their inner world of wants.
Clients are given the opportunity to explore every facet of their lives, including 
what they want from their family, friends, and work. Furthermore, this exploration 
of wants, needs, and perceptions should continue throughout the counseling pro-
cess as clients’ pictures change.
Here are some useful questions to help clients pinpoint what they want:
If you were the person that you wish you were, what kind of person 
would you be?
What would your family be like if your wants and their wants matched?
What would you be doing if you were living as you want to live?
Do you really want to change your life?
What is it you want that you don’t seem to be getting from life?
What do you think stops you from making the changes you would 
like?
Wubbolding  and  Brickell  (2009)  and  Gerdes,  Wubbolding,  and  Wubbolding  
(2012, p. 51) now include questions focused on perceptions:
How do you look at the situation?
Where do you see your control?
People have a great deal more control than they often perceive, and these ques-
tions help clients move from a sense of external control to a sense of internal con-
trol. This line of questioning sets the stage for applying other procedures in reality

therapy. It is an art for counselors to know what questions to ask, how to ask them, 
and when  to  ask  them.  Relevant  questions  help  clients  gain  insights  and  arrive  at  
plans  and  solutions.  Although  well-timed,  open-ended  questions  can  help  clients  
identify  their  counseling  goals,  excessive  questioning  can  result  in  resistance  and  
defensiveness.  In  this  phase  of  counseling,  clients  begin  to  commit  to  making  
changes in their behavior.
Direction and Doing The focus on the present is characterized by the key question 
asked by the reality therapist: “What are you doing?” Even though problems may be 
rooted  in  the  past,  clients  need  to  learn  how  to  deal  with  them  in  the  present  by  
learning better ways of getting what they want. Problems must be solved either in 
the  present  or  through  a  plan  for  the  future.  The  therapist’s  challenge  is  to  help  
clients make more need-satisfying choices.
Early in counseling it is essential to discuss with clients the overall direction of 
their lives, including where they are going and where their behavior is taking them. 
This exploration is preliminary to the subsequent evaluation of whether it is a desir-
able direction. The therapist holds a mirror before the client and asks, “What do you 
see for yourself now and in the future?” It often takes some time for this reflection to 
become clearer to clients so they can verbally express their perceptions.
Reality  therapy  focuses  on  gaining  awareness  of  and  changing  current  total  
behavior. To accomplish this, reality therapists focus on questions like these: “What 
are you doing now?” “What did you actually do yesterday?” “What did you want to 
do  differently  this  past  week?”  “What  stopped  you  from  doing  what  you  said  you  
wanted to do?” “What will you do tomorrow?”
Listening to clients talk about feelings can be productive, but only if it is linked 
to  what  they  are  doing.  When  an  emergency  light  on  the  car  dashboard  lights  up,  
the driver is alerted that something is wrong and that immediate action is necessary 
to remedy a problem. In a similar way, when clients talk about problematic feelings, 
most reality therapists affirm and acknowledge these feelings. Rather than focusing 
mainly on these feelings, however, reality therapists encourage clients to take action 
by  changing  what  they  are  doing  and  thinking.  It  is  easier  to  change  what  we  are  
doing and thinking than to change our feelings. From a choice theory perspective, 
discussions centering on feelings, without strongly relating them to what people are 
doing and thinking, are counterproductive.
Self-Evaluation self-evaluation  is  the  cornerstone  of  reality  therapy  procedures.  
“Conducting  a  searching  and  fearless  self-evaluation  is  the  royal  road  to  behavioral  
change”  (Wubbolding,  2015c,  p.  860).  Clients  are  asked  to  make  the  following  self-
evaluation: “Does your present behavior have a reasonable chance of getting you what 
you want now, and will it take you in the direction you want to go?” This evaluation 
involves the client examining behavioral direction, specific actions, wants, perceptions, 
new  directions,  and  plans  (Wubbolding,  2011b,  2015b).  Wubbolding  believes  that  
clients often present a problem with a significant relationship, which is at the root of 
much of their dissatisfaction. The counselor can help clients evaluate their behavior 
by  asking  this  question:  “Is  your  current  behavior  bringing  you  closer  to  people  
important to you or is it driving you further apart?” Through skillful questioning, the 
counselor helps clients determine if what they are doing is helping them.

Artful  questioning  assists  clients  in  evaluating  their  present  behavior  and  the  
direction this is taking them. Wubbolding (2000, 2011a, 2015b) suggests questions 
like these:
Is what you are doing helping or hurting you?
Is what you are doing now what you want to be doing?
Is your behavior working for you?
Is there a healthy congruence between what you are doing and what you 
believe?
Is what you are doing against the rules?
Is what you want realistic or attainable?
Does it help you to look at it that way?
Is it really true that you have no control over your situation?
How committed are you to the therapeutic process and to changing 
your life?
After carefully examining what you want, does it appear to be in your 
best interests and in the best interest of others?
Asking clients to evaluate each component of their total behavior is a major task 
in reality therapy. It is the counselor’s task to assist clients in evaluating the quality 
of their actions and to help them make responsible choices and devise effective plans.
Individuals will not change until they first decide that a change would be more 
advantageous.  Without  an  honest  self-assessment,  it  is  unlikely  that  clients  will  
change. Reality therapists are relentless in their efforts to help clients conduct explicit 
self-evaluations  of  each  behavioral  component.  When  therapists  ask  a  depressing  
client if this behavior is helping in the long run, they introduce the idea of choice to 
the client. The process of evaluation of the doing, thinking, feeling, and physiologi-
cal components of total behavior is within the scope of the client’s responsibility.
Reality therapists may be directive with certain clients at the beginning of treat-
ment to help clients recognize that some behaviors are not effective. In working with 
clients who are in crisis, for example, it is sometimes necessary to suggest straight-
forwardly  what  will  work  and  what  will  not.  Other  clients,  such  as  alcoholics  and  
children of alcoholics, need direction early in the course of treatment, for they often 
do not have the thinking behaviors in their control system to be able to make con-
sistent  evaluations  of  when  their  lives  are  seriously  out  of  effective  control.  These  
clients are likely to have blurred pictures and, at times, to be unaware of what they 
want or whether their wants are realistic. As they grow and continue to interact with 
the counselor, they learn to make evaluations with less and less help from the coun-
selor (Wubbolding, 2011a; Wubbolding & Brickell, 2005).
Planning  and  Action  Much  of  the  significant  work  of  the  counseling  process  
involves helping clients identify specific ways to fulfill their wants and needs. Once 
clients determine what they want to change, they are generally ready to explore other 
possible behaviors and formulate an action plan. The key question is, “What is your 
plan?”  The  process  of  creating  and  carrying  out  plans  enables  people  to  begin  to  
gain effective control over their lives. If the plan does not work, for whatever reason, 
the  counselor  and  client  work  together  to  devise  a  different  plan.  The  plan  gives  
the client a starting point, a toehold on life, but plans can be modified as needed.

Throughout  this  planning  phase,  the  counselor  continually  urges  the  client  to  be  
willing to accept the consequences for his or her own choices and actions. Not only 
are plans discussed in light of how they can help the client personally, but plans are 
also designed in terms of how they are likely to affect others in the client’s life.
Wubbolding (2000, 2007, 2011a, 2011b, 2013, 2015b) discusses the central role 
of planning and commitment. The culmination of the cycle of counseling rests with 
a plan of action. Although planning is important, it is effective only if the client has 
made a self-evaluation and determined that he or she wants to change a behavior. 
Wubbolding uses the acronym SAMIC to capture the essence of a good plan: simple, 
attainable, measurable, immediate, involved, controlled by the planner, committed 
to,  and  consistently  done.  Wubbolding  contends  that  clients  gain  more  effective  
control over their lives with plans that have the following characteristics:
The plan is within the limits of the motivation and capacities of the cli-
ent. Skillful counselors help clients identify plans that involve greater 
need-fulfilling payoffs. Clients may be asked, “What plans could you 
make now that would result in a more satisfying life?”
Good plans are simple and easy to understand. They are realistically 
doable, positive rather than negative, dependent on the planner, spe-
cific, immediate, and repetitive. Although they need to be specific, con-
crete, and measurable, plans should be flexible and open to revision as 
clients gain a deeper understanding of the specific behaviors they want 
to change.
The plan involves a positive course of action, and it is stated in terms of 
what the client is willing to do. Even small plans can help clients take 
significant steps toward their desired changes.
Counselors encourage clients to develop plans that they can carry out 
independently of what others do. Plans that are contingent on others 
lead clients to sense that they are not steering their own ship but are at 
the mercy of the ocean.
Effective plans are repetitive and, ideally, are performed daily.
Plans are carried out as soon as possible. Counselors can ask the ques-
tion, “What are you willing to do today to begin to change your life?”
Plans involve process-centered activities. For example, clients may plan 
to do any of the following: apply for a job, write a letter to a friend, 
take a yoga class, substitute nutritious food for junk food, devote two 
hours a week to volunteer work, or take a vacation that they have been 
wanting.
Before clients carry out their plan, it is a good idea for them to evaluate 
it with their therapist to determine whether it is realistic and attainable 
and whether it relates to what they need and want. After the plan has 
been carried out in real life, it is useful to evaluate it again and make 
any revisions that may be necessary.
To help clients commit themselves to their plan, it is useful for them to 
firm it up in writing.
Resolutions and plans are empty unless there is a commitment to carry them out. 
It is up to clients to determine how to take their plans outside the restricted world

of  therapy  and  into  the  everyday  world.  Effective  therapy  can  be  the  catalyst  that  
leads to self-directed, responsible living.
Asking  clients  to  determine  what  they  want  for  themselves,  to  make  a  self-
evaluation,  and  to  follow  through  with  action  plans  includes  assisting  them  in  
determining how intensely they are willing to work to attain the changes they desire. 
Commitment  is  not  an  all-or-nothing  matter;  it  exists  in  degrees.  Wubbolding  
(2007,  2011a,  2011b)  maintains  that  it  is  important  for  a  therapist  to  ask  about  
clients’ level of commitment, or how much they are willing to work to bring about 
change. This communicates in an implicit way to clients that they have within them 
the power to take charge of their lives. It is essential that those clients who are reluc-
tant to make a commitment be helped to express and explore their fears of failing. 
Clients are helped by a therapist who does not easily give up believing in their ability 
to  make  better  choices,  even  if  they  are  not  always  successful  in  completing  their  
plans. In his workshops, Wubbolding often mentions this axiom of reality therapy: 
“To fail to plan is to plan to fail.”
Application to Group Counseling
With  the  emphasis  on  connection  and  interpersonal  relationships,  real-
ity therapy is well suited for various kinds of group counseling. Groups provide 
members with many opportunities for exploring ways to meet their needs through 
the  relationships  formed  within  the  group.  In  particular,  the  WDEP  system  can  
be  applied  to  helping  group  members  satisfy  their  basic  needs.  If  members  talk  
about their past experiences or make excuses for their current behavior, the group 
leader redirects them to what they are presently doing. From the very beginning of 
a group, the members can be asked to take an honest look at what they are doing 
and  to  clarify  whether  their  behavior  is  getting  them  what  they  say  they  want.  
Once group members get a clearer picture of what they have in their life now and 
what they want to be different, they can use the group as a place to explore alter-
native courses of behavior.
This model lends itself to expecting the members to carry out homework assign-
ments between the group meetings. However, it is the members, with the help of the 
leader,  who  evaluate  their  own  behavior  and  decide  whether  they  want  to  change  
some  aspect  of  their  life.  Members  also  take  the  lead  in  deciding  what  kinds  of  
homework tasks they will set for themselves as a way to achieve their goals. Group 
leaders often meet with resistance if they make poorly timed suggestions and plans 
for  how  the  members  should  best  live.  To  their  credit,  reality  therapists  continue  
asking the members to evaluate for themselves whether what they are doing is get-
ting them what they want. If the members concede that what they are doing is not 
working for them, their resistance is much more likely to melt, and they tend to be 
more open to trying different behaviors.
Once  the  members  make  some  changes,  reality  therapy  provides  the  structure  
for them to formulate specific plans for action and to evaluate their level of success. 
Feedback from the members and the leader can help individuals design realistic and 
attainable plans. Considerable time is devoted during the group sessions for devel-
oping and implementing plans. If people do not carry out a plan, it is important to 
discuss  with  them  what  stopped  them.  Perhaps  they  set  their  goals  unrealistically

high, or perhaps there is a discrepancy between what they say they want to change 
and the steps they are willing to take to bring about change.
I also like reality therapy’s insistence that change will not come by insight alone; 
rather, members have to begin doing something different once they determine that 
their behavior is not working for them. I am skeptical about the value of catharsis 
as a therapeutic vehicle unless the release of pent-up emotions is eventually put into 
some  kind  of  cognitive  framework  and  is  followed  up  with  an  action  plan.  In  the  
groups that I facilitate, group members are challenged to look at the futility of wait-
ing for others to change. I ask members to assume that the significant people in their 
life may never change, which means that they will have to take a more active stance 
in shaping their own destiny. I appreciate the emphasis of reality therapy on teach-
ing clients that the only life they can control is their own and the focus placed on 
helping group members change their own patterns of acting and thinking.
For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  reality  therapy  in  groups,  see  Corey  (2016,  
chap. 15).
Choice Theory/Reality Therapy From a Multicultural 
Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
The  core  principles  of  choice  theory  and  reality  therapy  have  much  to  offer  
in  the  area  of  multicultural  counseling.  In  cross-cultural  therapy  it  is  essential  that  
counselors respect the differences in worldview between themselves and their clients. 
Counselors demonstrate their respect for the cultural values of their clients by help-
ing them explore how satisfying their current behavior is both to themselves and to 
others. Once clients make this assessment, they can formulate realistic plans that are 
consistent with their cultural values. It is a further sign of respect that the counselor 
refrains  from  deciding  what  specific  behaviors  should  be  changed.  Through  skillful  
questioning on the counselor’s part, clients from diverse ethnic backgrounds can be 
helped to determine the degree to which they have become acculturated into the dom-
inant society. Is it possible for them to find a balance, retaining their ethnic identity 
and values while integrating some of the values and practices of the dominant group? 
Again, the counselor does not determine this balance for clients, but works with them 
to arrive at their own answers. With this focus on thinking and acting rather than on 
exploring feelings, many clients are less likely to display resistance to counseling.
Wubbolding (2007, 2011a, 2011b) asserts that the principles underlying choice 
theory are universal, which makes choice theory applicable to all people. We are all 
members  of  the  same  species  and  have  the  same  genetic  structure;  therefore,  rela-
tionships are the problem in all cultures. All of us have internal needs, we all make 
choices, and we all seek to influence the world around us. Putting the principles of 
choice theory into action demands creativity, sensitivity to cultures and individuals, 
and  flexibility  in  implementing  the  procedures  of  reality  therapy.  Reality  therapy  
principles  and  procedures  need  to  be  applied  differently  in  various  cultures  and  
must  be  adapted  to  the  psychological  and  developmental  levels  presented  by  indi-
viduals (Wubbolding, 2011b).

328            CHAPTER ELEVEN
Based  on  the  assumption  that  reality  therapy  must  be  modified  to  fit  the  cul-
tural context of people other than North Americans, Wubbolding (2000, 2011a) and 
Wubbolding and colleagues (1998, 2004) have expanded the practice of reality therapy 
to  multicultural  situations.  Wubbolding’s  experience  in  conducting  reality  therapy  
workshops in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, India, Kuwait, Morocco, 
Malta,  Romania,  Australia,  Slovenia,  Croatia,  and  countries  in  western  Europe  has  
taught him the difficulty of generalizing about other cultures. Growing out of these 
multicultural experiences, Wubbolding (2000) has adapted the cycle of counseling in 
working with Japanese clients. He points to some basic language differences between 
Japanese and Western cultures. North Americans are inclined to say what they mean 
and to be assertive. In Japanese culture, assertive language is not appropriate between 
a child and a parent or between an employee and a supervisor. Ways of communicat-
ing are more indirect. To ask some Japanese clients what they want may seem harsh 
and intrusive to them. Because of these style differences, adaptations may be needed 
to make the practice of reality therapy relevant to Japanese clients:
The reality therapist’s tendency to ask direct questions may need to be 
softened, with questions being raised more elaborately and indirectly. It 
may be a mistake to ask individualistic questions built around whether 
specific behaviors meet the client’s need. Confrontation should be done 
only after carefully considering the context.
There is no exact Japanese translation for the word “plan,” nor is there 
an exact word for “accountability,” yet both of these are key dimensions 
in the practice of reality therapy and are central to Japanese culture.
In asking clients to make plans and commit to them, Western counsel-
ors do not settle for a response of “I’ll try.” Instead, they tend to push 
for an explicit pledge to follow through. In Japanese culture, however, 
the counselor is likely to accept “I’ll try” as a firm commitment.
These  are  but  a  few  illustrations  of  ways  in  which  reality  therapy  might  be  
adapted to non-Western clients. Even though all people have the same basic needs 
(survival,  love  and  belonging,  power,  freedom,  and  fun),  the  way  these  needs  are  
expressed depends largely on the cultural context. In working with culturally diverse 
clients, the therapist must allow latitude for a wide range of acceptable behaviors to 
satisfy these needs. As with other theories and the techniques that flow from them, 
flexibility is a foremost requirement.
A key strength of reality therapy is that it provides clients with tools to make the 
changes they desire. This is especially true during the planning phase, which is cen-
tral to the process of reality therapy. The focus is on positive steps that can be taken, 
not on what cannot be done. Clients identify those problems that are causing them 
difficulty, and these problems become the targets for change. This type of specificity 
and the direction that is provided by an effective plan are certainly assets in working 
with diverse client groups. Reality therapy is an open system that allows for flexibil-
ity in application based on the needs of culturally diverse individuals.
Reality therapy needs to be used artfully and to be applied in different ways with a 
variety of clients. Many of its principles and concepts can be incorporated in a dynamic 
and personal way in the style of counselors, and there is a basis for integrating these 
concepts with most of the other therapeutic approaches covered in this book.

Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
One  of  the  shortcomings  of  reality  therapy  in  working  with  clients  from  certain  
ethnic groups is that it may not take fully into account some very real environmen-
tal  forces  that  operate  against  them  in  their  everyday  lives.  Counselors  need  to  be  
broadly trained and be able to compensate for the limitation inherent in all counsel-
ing theories, Reality therapy gives only limited attention to helping people address 
environmental and social problems. Discrimination, racism, sexism, homophobia, 
heterosexism, ageism, negative attitudes toward disabilities, and other social injus-
tices are unfortunate realities, and these forces do limit many individuals in getting 
what they want from life. It is important that therapists acknowledge that people 
do not choose to be the victims of various forms of discrimination and oppression. 
If therapists do not accept these environmental restrictions or are not interested in 
bringing  about  social  justice  as  well  as  individual  change,  clients  are  likely  to  feel  
misunderstood.  There  is  a  danger  that  some  reality  therapists  may  overstress  the  
ability of these clients to take charge of their lives and not pay enough attention to 
systemic and environmental factors that can limit the potential for choice.
Some  reality  therapists  may  make  the  mistake  of  too  quickly  or  too  force-
fully stressing the ability of their clients to take charge of their lives. On this point, 
Wubbolding (2013) maintains that because of oppression and discrimination, some 
people have fewer choices available to them, yet they do have choices. Although focus-
ing on choices clients do have is useful, I believe clients may need to talk about the 
ways their choices are restricted by environmental circumstances. Therapists would 
do well to consider how both they and their clients could take even small steps toward 
bringing about societal changes, as do feminist therapists (see Chapter 12).
Another shortcoming associated with reality therapy is that some clients are very 
reluctant to directly verbally express what they need. Their cultural values and norms 
may not reinforce them in assertively asking for what they want. In fact, they may be 
socialized to think more of what is good for the social group than of their individual 
wants. In working with people with these values, counselors must “soften” reality ther-
apy somewhat. If reality therapy is to be used effectively with clients from other cul-
tures, the procedures must be adapted to the life experiences and values of members 
from various cultures (Wubbolding, 2000, 2011a; Wubbolding et al., 2004).

s a reality therapist, I am guided by the key con-
cepts  of  choice  theory  to  identify  Stan’s  behav-
ioral dynamics, to provide a direction for him to work 
toward, and to teach him about better alternatives for 
achieving what he wants. Stan has not been effective in 
getting what he needs—a satisfying relationship.
Stan has fallen into a victim role, blaming others, 
and looking backward instead of forward. Initially, he 
wants to tell me about the negative aspects of his life, 
which  he  does  by  dwelling  on  his  major  symptoms:   
depression,  anxiety,  inability  to  sleep,  and  other  psy-
chosomatic  symptoms.  I  listen  carefully  to  his  con-
cerns,  but  I  hope  he  will  come  to  realize  that  he  has  
many  options  for  acting  differently.  I  operate  on  the  
premise that therapy will offer the opportunity to ex-
plore with Stan what he can build on—successes, pro-
ductive times, goals, and hopes for the future.
After creating a relationship with Stan, I am able 
to  show  him  that  he  does  not  have  to  be  a  victim  of  
his past unless he chooses to be, and I assure him that

Theory  and  Practice  of  Counseling  and  Psychotherapy:  
The  Case  of  Stan  and  Lecturettes,  Session  9  (reality  
therapy),  for  a  demonstration  of  my  approach  to  
counseling Stan from this perspective. This session 
deals with assisting Stan in forming an action plan.
he has rehashed his past miseries enough. As counsel-
ing  progresses,  Stan  learns  that  even  though  most  of  
his  problems  did  indeed  begin  in  childhood,  there  is  
little he can do now to undo his childhood. However, 
he can adopt a different perspective on his past experi-
ences  and  the  meaning  they  hold  for  him  today.  He  
eventually  realizes  that  he  has  a  great  deal  of  control  
over what he can do for himself now.
I  have  Stan  describe  how  his  life  would  be  differ-
ent if he were symptom free. I am interested in knowing 
what  he  would  be  doing  if  he  were  meeting  his  needs  
for  belonging,  achievement,  power,  freedom,  and  fun.  
I explain to him that he has an ideal picture of what he 
wants his life to be, yet he does not possess effective be-
haviors  for  meeting  his  needs.  I  talk  to  him  about  all  
of  his  basic  psychological  needs  and  how  this  type  of  
therapy will teach him to satisfy them in effective ways. 
I also explain that his total behavior is made up of acting, 
thinking, feeling, and physiology. Even though he says 
he  hates  feeling  anxious  most  of  the  time,  Stan  learns  
that much of what he is doing and thinking is directly 
leading to his unwanted feelings and physiological reac-
tions. When he complains of feeling depressed much of 
the  time,  anxious  at  night,  and  overcome  by  panic  at-
tacks, I let him know that I am more interested in what 
he is doing and thinking because these are the behavioral 
components that can be directly changed.
I help Stan understand that his depressing is the feel-
ing part of his choice. Although he may think he has lit-
tle control over how he feels, over his bodily sensations, 
and  over  his  thoughts,  I  want  him  to  understand  that  
he  can  begin  to  take  different  action,  which  is  likely  to  
change  his  depressing  experience.  I  frequently  ask  this  
question,  “Is  what  you  are  choosing  to  do  getting  you  
what  you  want?”  I  lead  Stan  to  begin  to  recognize  that  
he does have some, indirect control over his feelings. This 
is  best  done  after  he  has  made  some  choices  about  do-
ing  something  different  from  what  he  has  been  doing.  
At this point he is in a better place to see that the choice 
to  take  action  has  contributed  to  feeling  better,  which  
helps him realize that he has some power to change.
Stan tells me about the pictures in his head, a few 
of which are becoming a counselor, acting confident in 
meeting  people,  thinking  of  himself  as  a  worthwhile  
person,  and  enjoying  life.  Through  therapy  he  makes  
the evaluation that much of what he is doing is not get-
ting  him  closer  to  these  pictures  or  getting  him  what  
he wants. After he decides that he is willing to work on 
himself to be different, the majority of time in the ses-
sions  is  devoted  to  making  plans  and  discussing  their  
implementation. We both focus on the specific steps he 
can take right now to begin the changes he would like.
As  Stan  continues  to  carry  out  plans  in  the  real  
world, he gradually begins to experience success. When 
he does backslide, we talk about this and together help 
him fine tune his plan. I am not willing to give up on 
Stan even when he does not make major progress, and 
Stan lets me know that my support is a source of real 
inspiration for him to keep working on himself.
I  teach  Stan  about  choice  theory  and  encourage  
him to do some reading that can stimulate his think-
ing about changes in his life. Stan brings some of what 
he  is  learning  from  his  reading  into  his  sessions,  and  
eventually he is able to achieve some of his goals. The 
combination  of  working  with  a  reality  therapist,  his  
reading,  and  his  willingness  to  put  what  he  is  learn-
ing into practice by engaging in new behaviors in the 
world  assist  him  in  replacing  ineffective  choices  with  
life-affirming choices. Stan comes to accept that he is 
the only person who can control his destiny.
Questions for Reflection
If Stan complains of feeling depressed most of the 
time and wants you to “fix” him, how would you 
proceed?
If Stan persists, telling you that his mood is get-
ting the best of him and that he wants you to work 
with his physician in getting him on an antide-
pressant drug, what would you say or do?
What are some of Stan’s basic needs that are not 
being met? What action plans can you think of to 
help Stan find better ways of getting what he wants?
Would you be inclined to do a checklist on alcoholism 
with Stan? Why or why not? If you determined that 
he was addicted to alcohol, would you insist that he 
attend a program such as Alcoholics Anonymous in 
conjunction with therapy with you? Why or why not?
What interventions would you make to help Stan 
explore his total behavior?

G
wen  has  lived  for  a  long  time  believing  therapy  
was for weak and crazy people, and certainly not 
for an African American woman of strong faith. Gwen 
has not been in therapy before, and I need to establish 
a climate of trust and respect so she feels it is safe to ex-
press her feelings. As we develop our working alliance, 
I  help  Gwen  understand  that  she  has  already  begun  
the change process by doing something different and 
coming in for therapy.
Therapist: Tell me what you want your life to be like? 
[Inquiry about her quality world]
Gwen:
 I want to feel appreciated and relaxed. I don’t 
want work to be the most important aspect of my 
life. I want to feel strong and healthy in my body.  
I am tired of feeling achy and overwhelmed. I want 
to feel respected and loved by my family. I am tired 
of feeling like I have to do everything alone.
Therapist: Think back over this past week and tell me 
something you did to move yourself closer to the 
life you want.
Gwen: I took a beginner’s yoga class, and it helped me 
relax. I didn’t feel as achy the next day, so I signed up 
for an eight-week class. [Gwen tries out a new behavior]
Therapist: That’s great. I am proud of you! You sound 
committed.
Gwen has gotten into the habit of letting life hap-
pen  to  her  rather  than  taking  the  steering  wheel  and  
driving in the direction of her hopes and dreams. For 
real change to occur, Gwen must “do” something dif-
ferent. The yoga class is a good start for her plan.
Therapist: Now think about what you can do differ-
ently in another aspect of your life to move closer 
to your ideal scene.
Gwen: I feel like I am doing a lot already.
Therapist: You are doing a lot. Is that what you want 
to continue to do? [A reality check]
Gwen: I know I need to prioritize my life and put 
myself first. I know I take on too much. It’s a bad 
habit, and it is wearing me out. [Self-evaluation]
Therapist:
 How well is taking on the role of a martyr 
working for you? [No criticism is implied]
Gwen: Not at all! I watched my grandmother wear 
herself out taking care of the entire family. I need 
to pull back.
I will not abandon Gwen if she does not meet her 
goals  or  if  her  plans  are  unsuccessful.  I  do  challenge  
her in an empathic and supportive manner to discuss 
what she can do to get back on course. I stay commit-
ted to Gwen and help her make the small incremental 
changes that she desires.
Therapist:
 What are you willing to do differently this 
week that you can commit to?
Gwen: I can make sure I get more time for myself. I 
will definitely do the yoga at least twice a week to 
help me with my flexibility and stress management. 
I can set up Meals on Wheels for my mom. That 
could really free up some of my time.
Therapist: Those are good first steps. You are on your 
way to creating a healthy action plan for your life. 
Taking these steps can help relieve some of the 
anxiety you have been feeling. I will check in with 
you next week at the beginning of our session to 
see how well you carried out your plan.
Before  she  leaves,  I  encourage  Gwen  to  consider  
reading a book I suggest. We will build on her action 
plan at the next session.
Therapist: Do you think you could find time to read 
a short book that is easy to read? [I give her Wub-
bolding’s book, A Set of Directions for Putting and 
Keeping Yourself Together] This will give you some 
ideas on action steps you might want to take in 
other areas of your life. Start by picking just one or 
two of the activities that you think you can use.
Gwen: What other changes do you think I should 
make?
The success of our work together depends not only 
on my skill and ability to establish a relationship with 
Gwen but also on her willingness to take responsibility

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
The reality therapist functions as a teacher, a mentor, and a model, confront-
ing  clients  in  ways  that  will  help  them  evaluate  what  they  are  doing  and  whether  
their  behavior  is  fulfilling  their  basic  needs  without  harming  themselves  or  oth-
ers. The heart of reality therapy is learning how to make better and more effective 
choices and gain more effective control. People take charge of their lives rather than 
being  the  victims  of  circumstances  beyond  their  control.  Practitioners  of  reality  
therapy  focus  on  what  clients  are  able  and  willing  to  do  in  the  present  to  change  their  
behavior. Practitioners teach clients how to make significant connections with oth-
ers. Therapists continue to ask clients to evaluate the effectiveness of what they are 
choosing to do to determine if better choices are possible.
The practice of reality therapy weaves together two components, the counseling 
environment  and  specific  procedures  that  lead  to  changes  in  behavior.  This  thera-
peutic  process  enables  clients  to  move  in  the  direction  of  getting  what  they  want.  
The  goals  of  reality  therapy  include  behavioral  change,  better  decision  making,  
improved significant relationships, enhanced living, and more effective satisfaction 
of all the psychological needs.
Contributions of Choice Theory/Reality Therapy
Among the advantages of reality therapy are its relatively short-term focus and the 
fact  that  it  deals  with  conscious  behavioral  problems.  Insight  and  awareness  are  
not enough; the client’s self-evaluation, a plan of action, and a commitment to fol-
lowing through are the core of the therapeutic process. I like the focus on strongly 
332            CHAPTER ELEVEN
for her behavior and her willingness to make alterna-
tive choices. I want to support Gwen as she discovers 
her  own  answers  to  that  question.  I  refrain  from  tell-
ing her what to choose for her action plan. Her success 
must come from her own evaluation of what needs to 
shift in her life.
Therapist: This is your journey, and you know best 
what changes could be beneficial for you. Keep 
your hands on the steering wheel of your life and 
notice how you begin to feel once you get in the 
habit of saying, “yes” to your health and well-being. 
Take things slowly. There is no need to rush and 
make a lot of changes right away.
I hope Gwen will notice a difference in her anxiety 
level  as  she  begins  to  implement  her  action  plan.  As  
she  feels  more  comfortable  with  taking  charge  of  her  
life, I believe that she will be able to tackle more signifi-
cant changes, such as setting clear boundaries with her 
adult  children.  Gwen  is  beginning  to  venture  down  a  
new road. She is stepping up to a new level of personal 
responsibility and is moving away from being a passive 
victim of her life circumstances.
Questions for Reflection
What interventions did the therapist make to help 
Gwen evaluate her current behavior?
Assess the usefulness of this question in working 
with Gwen: “Is what you’re doing helping you get 
what you want?”
To what degree do you think Gwen is ready to 
make an action plan?
How would you describe the interaction and the 
relationship between the therapist and Gwen.

encouraging  clients  to  engage  in  self-evaluation,  to  decide  if  what  they  are  doing  
is  working  or  not,  and  to  commit  themselves  to  doing  what  is  required  to  make  
changes  they  desire.  The  existential  underpinnings  of  choice  theory  are  a  major  
strength of this approach, which accentuates taking responsibility for what we are 
doing. People are not viewed as being hopelessly and helplessly depressed. Instead, 
people are viewed as doing the best they can, or making the choices they hope will 
result in fulfilling their needs. With the emphasis on responsibility and choice, indi-
viduals can acquire a sense of self-direction and empowerment.
Too  often  counseling  fails  because  therapists  have  an  agenda  for  clients.  The  
reality therapist helps clients conduct a searching inventory of what they are doing. 
If individuals determine that their present behavior is not working, they are then 
much more likely to consider acquiring a new behavioral repertoire. Many clients 
approach  counseling  with  a  great  deal  of  skepticism.  Reality  therapy  can  be  used  
effectively  with  individuals  who  manifest  reluctance  and  ambivalence  to  change.  
For example, in working with people with addictions, reality therapy strategies can 
be  used  to  help  clients  evaluate  where  their  behavior  is  leading  them  and  to  pro-
vide clients with options to bring about positive changes in their behavior. Reality 
therapy  has  been  effectively  used  in  addiction  treatment  and  recovery  programs  
for more than 30 years (Wubbolding & Brickell, 2005). With these populations, it 
would  be  inappropriate  to  embark  on  long-term  therapy  that  delves  into  uncon-
scious dynamics and an intensive exploration of one’s past. Addressing what clients 
are  presently  doing  and  asking  clients  to  evaluate  what  they  want  to  change  fits  
well in various settings. Reality therapy is an effective, short-term approach, often 
requiring 10 sessions or less, that can enable people to make life changes without 
prolonged therapy.
Limitations and Criticisms of Choice Theory/Reality Therapy
From my perspective, one of the main limitations of reality therapy is that it does 
not give adequate emphasis to the role of the following aspects of the counseling 
process: the role of insight, the unconscious, the power of the past and the effect 
of traumatic experiences in early childhood, the therapeutic value of dreams, and 
the place of transference. Because reality therapy focuses almost exclusively on con-
sciousness, it does not take into account factors such as repressed conflicts and the 
power of the unconscious in influencing how we think, feel, behave, and choose.
Dealing with dreams is not part of the reality therapist’s repertoire. According 
to Glasser (2001), it is not therapeutically useful to explore dreams, an idea which I 
find limiting in this approach. For him, spending time discussing dreams can be a 
defense used to avoid talking about one’s behavior and, thus, is time wasted. From 
my  perspective,  dreams  are  powerful  tools  in  helping  people  recognize  their  inter-
nal  conflicts.  I  believe  that  there  is  richness  in  dreams,  which  can  be  a  shorthand  
message of clients’ central struggles, wants, hopes, and visions of the future. Asking 
clients  to  recall,  report,  share,  and  relive  their  dreams  in  the  here  and  now  of  the  
therapeutic session can help unblock them and can pave the way for clients to take 
a different course of action.
Similarly,  I  have  a  difficult  time  accepting  Glasser’s  view  of  transference  as  a  
misleading concept, for I find that clients are able to learn that significant people in

their lives have a present influence on how they perceive and react to others. To rule 
out an exploration of transference that distorts accurate perception of others seems 
narrow in my view.
I  believe  reality  therapy  is  vulnerable  to  the  practitioner  who  assumes  the  role  
of  an  expert  in  deciding  for  others  how  life  should  be  lived  and  what  constitutes  
responsible behavior. Wubbolding (2013) admits that reality therapy can lend itself 
to fixing problems and imposing a therapist’s values on clients, especially by inex-
perienced  or  inadequately  trained  counselors.  Wubbolding  adds  that  it  is  not  the  
therapist’s role to evaluate the behavior of clients. Generally, clients need to engage 
in a process of courageous self-evaluation to determine how well certain behaviors 
are working and what changes they may want to make. It is critical that therapists 
monitor any tendency to judge clients’ behavior, but instead to do all that is possible 
to get clients to make their own evaluation of their behavior.
Finally,  reality  therapy  makes  use  of  concrete  language  and  simple  concepts.  
This  can  erroneously  be  viewed  as  a  simple  approach  that  does  not  require  a  high  
level of competence. Because reality therapy is easily understood, it might appear to 
be easy to implement. However, the effective practice of reality therapy requires prac-
tice, supervision, and continuous learning (Wubbolding, 2007, 2011a). Competent 
reality  therapists  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  choice  theory  and  have  mas-
tered the art of applying reality therapy procedures to working with diverse clients 
with a range of clinical problems.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What do you think of reality therapy’s focus on present behavior and 
lack of attention to past events?
2.
 How could you help your clients to make a self-evaluation to determine 
if what they are doing is working for them?
3.
 If you are working with involuntary clients, how could you use choice 
theory and reality therapy principles to increase their cooperation with 
the therapy program?
4.
 What potential do you see in combining reality therapy with some of 
the other therapies you have studied? Which theory would you most be 
inclined to integrate with reality therapy?
5. Think of a behavior you would like to change. What are some steps you 
would take in creating an action plan to get what you want?

Some Contemporary FeminiSt therapiStS
Feminist  therapy  does  not  have  a  single  founder.  
Rather,  it  has  been  a  collective  effort  by  many.  We  
have selected a few individuals who have made signif-
icant contributions to feminist therapy for inclusion 
here,  recognizing  full  well  that  many  other  equally  
influential scholar-practitioners could have appeared 
in this space. Feminist therapy is truly founded on a 
theory of inclusion.

fEMInIsT THERAPY         339 
Introduction
The broad scope of feminist thought goes far beyond gender considerations. 
Multicultural and social justice issues are equally relevant to the therapeutic enter-
prise, and, as you will see, feminist counseling/therapy puts intersections of gender 
and other social identities, social location, and power at the core of the therapeutic 
process. Feminist counseling is built on the premise that it is essential to consider 
the  social,  cultural,  and  political  context  that  contributes  to  a  person’s  problems  
in  order  to  understand  that  person.  This  perspective  has  significant  implications  
for the development of counseling theory and for how practitioners intervene with 
diverse client populations.
Feminist psychotherapy is a philosophical orientation that lends itself to an 
integration  of  feminist,  multicultural,  and  social  justice  concepts  with  a  variety  of  
psychotherapy  approaches  (Enns,  Williams,  &  Fassinger,  2013).  A  central  concept  
in  feminist  therapy  is  the  importance  of  understanding  and  acknowledging  psy-
chological  oppression  and  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  sociopolitical  status  to  
which women, underrepresented, and marginalized individuals have been relegated. 
A feminist  perspective  offers  a  unique  approach  to  understanding  the  roles  that  
women  and  men  with  diverse  social  identities  and  experiences  have  been  social-
ized  to  accept  and  to  bringing  this  understanding  into  the  therapeutic  process.  
The  socialization  of  women  with  multiple  social  identities  inevitably  affects  their  
identity development, self-concept, goals and aspirations, and emotional well-being 
(Gilligan,  1982;  King,  2013;  Turner  &  Werner-Wilson,  2008).  As  Natalie  Rogers  
(1995)  has  observed,  socialization  patterns  tend  to  result  in  women  giving  away  
their  power  in  relationships,  often  without  being  aware  of  it.  Feminist  counseling  
keeps knowledge about gender socialization, sexism, and related “isms” in mind in 
the work with all. For some women, ethnicity or race may be experienced as a more 
salient identity than gender; for others, identity and the oppression associated with 
gender may be fused with racism.

The  majority  of  clients  in  counseling  are  women,  and  the  majority  of  psycho-
therapy practitioners at the master’s level are women. However, most theories that 
are  traditionally  taught—including  all  of  the  other  theories  in  this  book—were  
founded by White males from Western (American or European) cultures, with only 
Adler taking a pro-feminist stance in early theory development. The need for a the-
ory  that  evolves  from  the  thinking  and  experiencing  of  women  seems  self-evident.  
Theories are developed from the experiences of the “developer,” and feminist theory 
is the first therapeutic theory to emerge from a collective effort by women to include 
the experiences of multiple voices.
Feminist therapists have challenged male-oriented assumptions regarding what 
constitutes a mentally healthy individual. Early feminist therapy efforts focused on 
valuing  women’s  experiences,  recognizing  political  realities,  and  understanding  the  
unique  issues  facing  women  within  a  patriarchal  system.  Contemporary  practice  
keeps the impact of gender socialization in the forefront when working with clients. 
Current feminist practice also emphasizes a diverse approach that includes an under-
standing of multiple oppressions, power, privilege, multicultural competence, social 
justice, and the oppression of all marginalized people (American Psychological Asso-
ciation, 2007; Enns & Byars-Winston, 2010). Feminists believe that gender cannot be 
considered apart from other identities related to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, 
age,  and  sexual  orientation.  Recent  developments  relevant  to  social  justice  in  psy-
chology have led to an integration of key themes of multiculturalism and feminism 
(Enns, Williams, & Fassinger, 2013). The contemporary version of feminist therapy 
and  the  multicultural  and  social  justice  perspectives  to  counseling  practice  have  a  
great deal in common (Crethar, Torres Rivera, & Nash, 2008). All these approaches 
provide a systemic perspective based on understanding the social context of clients’ 
lives and are aimed toward affecting social change as well as individual change.

History and Development
The history of feminist therapy is relatively brief. No single individual can be identi-
fied as the founder of this approach, reflecting a central theme of feminist collabo-
ration. Feminist therapy was developed by several feminist therapists, all of whom 
shared the same vision—to improve mental health treatment for women (Evans & 
Miller, 2016). The beginnings of feminism (often referred to as the first wave) can be 
traced to the late 1800s, but the women’s movement of the 1960s (the second wave) 
laid the foundation for the development of feminist therapy. In the 1960s women 
began uniting their voices to express their dissatisfaction with the limiting and con-
fining  nature  of  traditional  female  roles.  Consciousness-raising  groups,  in  which  
women  came  together  to  share  their  experiences  and  perceptions,  helped  individ-
ual  women  become  aware  that  they  were  not  alone.  A  sisterhood  developed,  and  
some of the services that evolved from women’s collective desires to improve society 
included shelters for battered women, rape crisis centers, and women’s health and 
reproductive health centers.

Believing that personal counseling was a legitimate means to effect change, fem-
inist therapists viewed therapy as a partnership between equals and built mutuality 
and  collaboration  into  the  therapeutic  process.  They  took  the  stance  that  therapy  
needed  to  move  away  from  an  intrapsychic  perspective  on  psychopathology  (in  
which the sources of a woman’s unhappiness reside within her) to a focus on under-
standing  the  social,  political,  and  cultural  forces  in  society  that  damage,  oppress,  
and constrain girls and women, as well as boys and men.
Gilligan’s (1982) work on the development of a morality of care in women, and 
the  work  of  Miller  (1986)  and  the  Stone  Center  scholars  in  developing  the  self-in-
relation  model  (now  called  the  “relational-cultural”  model)  were  influential  in  the  
evolution of a feminist personality theory. New theories emerged that honored the 
relational and cooperative dimensions of women’s experiencing (Enns, 1991, 2000, 
2004).  Feminist  therapists  began  to  formally  examine  the  relationship  of  feminist  
theory to traditional psychotherapy systems, and integrations with various existing 
systems  were  proposed.  Some  counselors  identified  themselves  as  psychoanalytic  
feminist therapists or as Adlerian-feminist counselors, to mention just two possible 
integrations.
By  the  1980s  feminist  group  therapy  had  changed  dramatically,  becoming  
more diverse as it focused increasingly on specific problems and issues such as body 
image,  abusive  relationships,  eating  disorders,  incest,  and  other  forms  of  sexual  
abuse (Enns, 1993). The feminist philosophies that guided the practice of therapy 
also became more diverse.
The  variety  within  feminist  theories  provides  a  range  of  different  but  overlap-
ping perspectives from which to work (Enns & Sinacore, 2001). Brown (2010) defines 
feminist therapy as a postmodern, technically integrative approach that emphasizes 
the analysis of gender, power, and social location as strategies for facilitating change. 
Feminist  therapists,  both  male  and  female,  believe  that  understanding  and  con-
fronting gender-role stereotypes and power are central to therapeutic practice and 
that  addressing  a  client’s  problems  requires  adopting  a  sociocultural  perspective:  
namely, understanding the impact of the society and culture in which a client lives.
Key Concepts
Constructs of Feminist Theory
Worell and Remer (2003) describe the constructs of feminist theory as being 
gender  fair,  flexible–multicultural,  interactionist,  and  life-span-oriented.  gender-
fair  approaches  explain  differences  in  the  behavior  of  women  and  men  in  terms  
of  socialization  processes  rather  than  on  the  basis  of  our  “innate”  natures,  thus  
avoiding  dichotomized  stereotypes  in  social  roles  and  interpersonal  behavior.  A  
flexible–multicultural perspective uses concepts and strategies that apply equally 
to  individuals  and  groups  regardless  of  age,  race,  culture,  gender,  ability,  class,  or  
sexual orientation. The interactionist view contains concepts specific to the think-
ing, feeling, and behaving dimensions of human experience and accounts for con-
textual  and  environmental  factors.  A  life-span  perspective  assumes  that  human  
development is a lifelong process and that personality and behavioral changes can 
occur at any time rather than being fixed during early childhood.

342            CHAPTER TWElVE
Feminist Perspective on Personality Development
Feminist  therapists  emphasize  that  societal  gender-role  expectations  profoundly  
influence a person’s identity from the moment of birth, or even prior to birth once 
the  sex  is  identified,  and  become  deeply  ingrained  in  adult  personality.  Gilligan  
(1977) recognized that theories of moral development were based almost exclusively 
on research with White males. Gilligan was the first to recognize that male develop-
ment was presented as the norm and that development of women, though different, 
was  judged  by  male  norms.  As  a  result  of  her  studies  on  women’s  moral  and  psy-
chosocial development, Gilligan came to believe women’s sense of self and morality 
is based in issues of responsibility and care for other people and is embedded in a 
cultural  context.  She  posited  that  the  concepts  of  connectedness  and  interdepen-
dence—virtually ignored in male-dominated developmental theories—are central to 
women’s development.
Kaschak  (1992)  used  the  term  engendered  lives  to  describe  her  belief  that  gender  
is the organizing principle in people’s lives. She has studied the role gender plays in 
shaping  the  identities  of  females  and  males  and  believes  the  masculine  defines  the  
feminine. In most cultures what is considered attractive in a female is defined by men 
in that culture. For instance, because men pay great attention to women’s bodies in 
Western  society,  women’s  appearance  is  given  tremendous  importance.  It  is  easy  to  
see  how  this  perspective  gets  reified  in  both  eating  disorders  and  various  forms  of  
depression.  Men,  as  the  dominant  group,  also  define  and  determine  the  roles  that  
women play. Because women occupy a subordinate position, to survive and thrive in 
society they must be able to interpret the needs and behaviors of the dominant group. 
To that end, women have developed “women’s intuition” and have included in their 
gender schema an internalized belief that women are less important than men.
Females  are  raised  in  a  culture  grounded  in  sexism,  and  understanding  and  
acknowledging internalized oppression is central in feminist work. Like all marginal-
ized groups, women are bicultural. They share their own culture with other women and 
also have a deep understanding of the male culture that perpetuates patriarchy. Men, 
on the other hand, do not have to understand the culture of women in order to survive.
Feminist practitioners remind us that traditional gender stereotypes of women 
are  still  prevalent  in  cultures  throughout  the  world.  They  teach  their  clients  that  
uncritical acceptance of traditional roles can greatly restrict their range of freedom. 
Today many women and men are resisting being so narrowly defined. Women and 
men in therapy learn that, if they choose to, they can experience mutual behavioral 
characteristics such as accepting themselves as being interdependent, giving to oth-
ers,  being  open  to  receiving,  thinking  and  feeling,  and  being  tender  and  strong.  
Rather than being cemented to a single behavioral style, women and men who reject 
traditional  roles  are  saying  that  they  are  entitled  to  express  the  complex  range  of  
characteristics that are appropriate for different situations and that they are open to 
their vulnerability as human beings.
Relational-Cultural Theory
Most models of human growth and development emphasize a struggle toward inde-
pendence and autonomy, but feminists recognize that many women are searching for 
a connectedness with others as well as possibilities for autonomy. In feminist therapy,

women’s relational qualities are seen as strengths and as pathways for healthy growth 
and development, instead of being identified as weaknesses or defects.
The  founding  scholars  of  relational-cultural  theory  (rct)  have  elaborated  
on the vital role that relationships and connectedness with others play in the lives 
of women (Jordan, 2010; Jordan et al,, 1991; Miller, 1986, 1991; Miller et al., 1999; 
Miller  &  Stiver,  1997;  Surrey,  1991;  Trepal,  2010).  These  scholars  suggest  that  a  
woman’s sense of identity and self-concept develop in the context of relationships. 
They describe a process of relational movement in which women move through con-
nections,  disconnections,  and  enhanced  transformative  relationships  throughout  
their lives (Comstock et al., 2008). Therapists emphasize the qualities of authenticity 
and transparency that contribute to the flow of the relationship; being empathically 
present with the suffering of the client is at the core of treatment (Surrey & Jordan, 
2012).  Therapists  aim  to  lessen  the  suffering  caused  by  disconnection  and  isola-
tion, increase clients’ capacity for relational resilience, develop mutual empathy and 
mutual empowerment, and foster social justice (Jordan, 2010). According to Jordan, 
through mutual empathy people find that they can bring more of themselves into 
relationships, and in this process they become more open to learning and change. 
Jordan notes that RCT is not about helping people adjust to conditions; rather, this 
therapy is about enhancing the client’s desire for connection and building networks 
and community. Finding growth-fostering relationships leads to a greater sense of 
involvement in the world and in the well-being of others. Relational-cultural therapy 
practitioners emphasize mutual empathy and deep respect for the client, understand 
how disconnections affect the individual, and create a therapeutic relationship that 
is healing (Surrey & Jordan, 2012). For empathy to result in healing and decreased 
isolation, clients must be able to feel the therapist’s empathic response. As you will 
see, many of the techniques of feminist therapy foster mutuality, equality, relational 
capacities, and growth in connection.
Principles of Feminist Therapy
A number of feminist writers have articulated the interrelated and overlap-
ping core principles that form the foundation for the practice of feminist therapy:
1. The personal is political and critical consciousness. This principle is based 
on the assumption that the personal or individual problems individu-
als bring to counseling originate in a political and social context. For 
females this is often a context of marginalization, oppression, subordi-
nation, and stereotyping. Acknowledgment of the political and societal 
impact on an individual’s life is perhaps the most fundamental tenet 
that lies at the core of feminist therapy.
2.
 Commitment to social change. Feminist therapies aim not only for individ-
ual change but also for societal change. A distinctive feature of feminist 
therapy is the assumption that direct action for social change is one of 
the responsibilities of therapists. Counselors who work with women 
survivors of sexual violence also do social justice work to educate and 
transform the rape culture in which we live. It is important for clients 
who engage in the therapy process to recognize how some of their 
social identities may grant them unearned privileges and advantages as

well as to recognize how they have suffered from oppression as mem-
bers of a subordinate group and that they can join with others to right 
these wrongs. Counselors cannot help clients recognize privilege and 
oppression if they do not understand how these identities have affected 
their own lives. The goal is to advance a different vision of societal orga-
nization that frees both women and men from the constraints imposed 
by gender-role and social class-related expectations. This vision of 
counseling, which moves away from the traditional focus on change 
from within the individual out into the realm of social activism and 
societal change, distinguishes feminist therapy from other historically 
accepted approaches.
3.
 Women’s and girls’ voices and ways of knowing, as well as the voices of others 
who have experienced marginalization and oppression, are valued and their 
experiences are honored. Traditional therapies operate on androcentric, 
heterosexist norms embedded in White middle-class heterosexual val-
ues and describe women and other marginalized individuals as deviant. 
Feminist therapists replace patriarchal and other forms of “objective 
truth” with feminist and social justice consciousness and encourage 
clients to use their personal experience as a touchstone for determin-
ing what is “reality.” Shifting women’s experiences from being ignored 
and devalued to being sought after and valued is strongly encouraged 
by feminist therapists (Evans & Miller, 2016). When women’s voices 
are acknowledged as authoritative, invaluable sources of knowledge, 
women and other marginalized people can contribute to profound 
change in the body politic of society.
4.
 The counseling relationship is egalitarian. Attention to power is central in 
feminist therapy. The egalitarian relationship, which is marked by 
authenticity, mutuality, and respect, is at the core of feminist therapy 
(Pusateri & Headley, 2015). Feminist therapists recognize that there is a 
power imbalance in the therapeutic relationship, so they strive to shift 
power and privilege to the voices and experiences of clients and away 
from themselves. An open discussion of power and role differences in 
the therapeutic relationship helps clients to understand how power 
dynamics influence both counseling and other relationships and also 
invites a dialogue about ways to reduce power differentials (Enns, 2004; 
Evans & Miller, 2016).
5.
 A focus on strengths and a reformulated definition of psychological distress. 
Feminist therapy has a “conflicted and ambivalent relationship” with 
diagnostic labeling and the “disease model” of mental illness (Brown, 
2010, p. 50). Psychological distress is reframed, not as disease but as a 
communication about unjust systems. When contextual variables are 
considered, symptoms can be reframed as survival strategies. Feminist 
therapists talk about problems in the context of living and coping 
skills rather than pathology (Enns, 2004; Worell & Remer, 2003). For 
example, a client who is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse may pres-
ent with dissociation, which is understood as a way of coping in order 
to survive as a child.

6. All types of oppression are recognized along with the connections among them. 
Clients can best be understood in the context of their sociocultural 
environments. Feminist practitioners acknowledge that social and 
political inequities have a negative effect on all people. Feminist 
therapists work to help individuals make changes in their lives, but 
they also are committed to working toward social change that will 
liberate all members of society from stereotyping, marginalization, 
and oppression. Diverse sources of oppression, not simply gender, 
are identified and interactively explored as a basis for understanding 
the concerns that clients bring to therapy. Framing clients’ issues 
within a cultural context leads to empowerment, which can be fully 
realized only through social change (Evans & Miller, 2016; Worell & 
Remer, 2003).
The Therapeutic Process
Therapeutic Goals
According  to  Enns  (2004),  goals  of  feminist  therapy  include  empower-
ment,  valuing  and  affirming  diversity,  striving  for  change  rather  than  adjust-
ment, equality, balancing independence and interdependence, social change, and 
self-nurturance. A key goal of feminist therapy is to assist individuals in viewing 
themselves as active agents on their own behalf and on behalf of others. At the 
individual  level,  feminist  and  other  social  justice  therapists  work  to  help  indi-
viduals recognize, claim, and embrace their personal power. A related goal is to 
help individuals come together to strengthen collective power. Through empow-
erment, clients are able to free themselves from the constraints of their gender-
role  socialization  and  other  internalized  limitations  and  to  challenge  ongoing  
institutional oppression.
According to Worell and Remer (2003), feminist therapists help clients:
Become aware of their own gender-role socialization process
Identify their internalized messages of oppression and replace them 
with more self-enhancing beliefs
Understand how sexist and oppressive societal beliefs and practices 
influence them in negative ways
Acquire skills to bring about change in the environment
Restructure institutions to rid them of discriminatory practices
Develop a wide range of behaviors that are freely chosen
Evaluate the impact of social factors on their lives
Develop a sense of personal and social power
Recognize the power of relationships and connectedness
Trust their own experience and their intuition
Feminist therapists aim to empower all people to create a world of equality that 
is  reflected  at  individual,  interpersonal,  institutional,  national,  and  global  levels  
(Enns  &  Byars-Winston,  2010).  Making  oppression  transparent  is  the  first  step,  
but  the  ultimate  goal  is  to  replace  sexism  and  other  forms  of  discrimination  and

oppression  with  empowerment  for  all  marginalized  groups  (Brabeck  &  Brabeck,  
2013;  Worell  &  Remer,  2003).  Feminist  counseling  strives  for  transformation  for  
both the individual client and society as a whole.
Therapist’s Function and Role
Many therapeutic orientations articulate a belief in a therapeutic milieu that is free 
of biased assumptions about women and other oppressed and marginalized groups. 
Therapeutic orientations and counseling theories, on the whole, assert that all cli-
ents should be treated with respect. The difference between these approaches and 
feminist therapy is that feminist therapy is based firmly in feminist philosophy that 
centralizes the sociocultural context of clients’ mental health status.
Theories  and  techniques  are  based  on  the  lives  and  experiences  of  individuals  
(lived experiences) as well as research supporting gender and other inequities (Evans, 
Kincade,  &  Seem,  2011).  Feminist  therapists  have  shared  assumptions  about  ther-
apy,  but  they  come  from  diverse  backgrounds  and  have  various  lived  experiences  
that may affect how techniques are applied as well as how clients are conceptualized. 
In Case  Approach  to  Counseling  and  Psychotherapy  (Corey,  2013,  chap.  10),  three  femi-
nist therapists (Drs. Evans, Kincade, and Seem) team up to demonstrate a variety of 
feminist interventions in their work with Ruth. They also conceptualize the case of 
Ruth from a feminist therapy perspective.
Feminist  practitioners  have  integrated  feminism,  multiculturalism,  and  other  
social justice perspectives into their approach to therapy and into their lives. Their 
actions and beliefs and their personal and professional lives are congruent. They are 
committed to monitoring their own biases and distortions, especially the social and 
cultural dimensions of women’s experiences. Feminist and social justice therapists 
are also committed to understanding oppression in all its forms—including but not 
limited  to  sexism,  racism,  heterosexism—and  they  consider  the  impact  of  oppres-
sion and discrimination on psychological well-being. They value being emotionally 
present for their clients, being willing to share themselves during the therapy hour, 
modeling  proactive  behaviors,  and  being  committed  to  their  own  consciousness-
raising process (Evans, Kincade, Marbley & Seem, 2005).
Feminists  share  common  ground  with  Adlerian  therapists  in  their  empha-
sis  on  social  equality  and  social  interest,  and  with  existential  therapists  who  
emphasize therapy as a shared journey, one that is life changing for both client 
and  therapist,  and  with  their  basic  trust  in  the  client’s  ability  to  move  forward  
in a positive and constructive manner (Bitter, Robertson, Healey, & Cole, 2009). 
Feminist  therapists  believe  the  therapeutic  relationship  should  be  a  nonhierar-
chical,  person-to-person  relationship,  and  they  aim  to  empower  clients  to  live  
according  to  their  own  values  and  to  rely  on  an  internal  (rather  than  external  
or societal) locus of control in determining what is right for them. Like person-
centered  therapists,  feminist  therapists  convey  their  genuineness  and  strive  for  
mutual empathy between client and therapist. Unlike person-centered therapists, 
however,  feminist  therapists  do  not  see  the  therapeutic  relationship  alone  as  
being sufficient to produce change. Insight, introspection, and self-awareness are 
springboards to action.

Feminist  therapists  share  with  postmodern  therapists  (see  Chapter  13)  an  
emphasis on the politics and power relationships in the therapy process and a con-
cern about power relations in the world in general. Both feminist and postmodern 
thought asserts that psychotherapists must not replicate societal power imbalances 
or foster dependency in the client. Rather, therapist and client take active and equal 
roles, working together to determine goals and procedures. A common denomina-
tor  of  both  feminist  and  postmodern  approaches  is  the  avoidance  of  assuming  a  
therapist role of all-knowing expert.
Client’s Experience in Therapy
Clients  are  partners  in  the  therapeutic  process.  It  is  important  that  clients  
tell  their  stories  and  give  voice  to  their  experiencing.  Clients  determine  what  they  
want from therapy and are the experts on their own lives. A male client, for example, 
may choose to explore ways in which he has been both limited and privileged by his 
gender-role  socialization.  In  the  safe  environment  of  the  therapeutic  sessions,  he  
may  be  able  to  fully  experience  emotions  of  sadness,  tenderness,  uncertainty,  and  
empathy. As he transfers these ways of being to daily living, he may find that rela-
tionships change in his family, his social world, and at work.
Feminist practitioners recognize that gender is only one identity and source of 
marginalization and oppression, and they value the complex ways in which multiple 
identities shape a person’s concerns and preferences. Worell and Remer (2003) write 
that clients acquire a new way of looking at and responding to their world. They add 
that the shared journey of empowerment can be both frightening and exciting—for 
both client and therapist. Clients need to be prepared for major shifts in their way 
of viewing the world around them, changes in the way they perceive themselves, and 
transformed interpersonal relationships.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
In  feminist  therapy,  the  very  structure  of  the  client–therapist  relationship  
models  how  to  identify  and  use  power  responsibly.  A  defining  theme  of  the  client–
counselor relationship is the inclusion of clients in both the assessment and the treat-
ment process, keeping the therapeutic relationship as egalitarian as possible. Feminist 
therapists clearly state their values during the informed consent process to reduce the 
chance of value imposition. This allows clients to make a choice regarding whether or 
not to work with the therapist. It also is a step in demystifying the process.
As  mentioned,  although  there  is  an  inherent  power  differential  in  the  therapy  
relationship, feminist therapists are aware of ways they might abuse their own power 
in the therapy relationship, such as by diagnosing unnecessarily, or without the cli-
ent’s knowledge and input, by interpreting or giving advice, by staying aloof behind 
an “expert” role, or by discounting the impact the power imbalance between thera-
pist and client has on the relationship. They work to demystify the counseling rela-
tionship by sharing with the client their own perceptions about what is going on in 
the relationship, by conveying clearly that the client is the expert on her or his life, 
and by using appropriate self-disclosure.

Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The Role of Assessment and Diagnosis
Feminist  therapists  have  been  sharply  critical  of  past  versions  of  the  DSM  
classification system (DSM- III through DSM -IV-TR), as well as of the current DSM-5 
edition (Marecek & Gavey, 2013). This critique is based on research indicating that 
gender, culture, and race may influence assessment of clients’ symptoms (e.g., Enns, 
2000; Eriksen & Kress, 2005). To the degree that conceptualization and assessment 
are influenced by subtle forms of sexism, racism, ethnocentrism, heterosexism, age-
ism, or classism, it is extremely difficult to arrive at a meaningful conceptualization, 
assessment, or diagnosis.
From the perspective of feminist therapy, diagnoses are based on the dominant 
culture’s  view  of  normalcy  and  therefore  cannot  account  for  cultural  differences  
(Pusateri & Headley, 2015). Feminist therapists refer to distress rather than psycho-
pathology (Brown, 2010), and they use diagnostic labels quite carefully, if at all. They 
believe diagnostic labels are severely limiting for these reasons: (1) they focus on the 
individual’s  symptoms  and  not  the  social  factors  that  cause  distress  and  dysfunc-
tional  behavior;  (2)  they  are  part  of  a  system  developed  mainly  within  psychiatry,  
an institution that reinforces dominant cultural norms and may become an instru-
ment of oppression; (3) they may reflect the inappropriate application of power in 
the  therapeutic  relationship;  (4)  they  can  lead  to  an  overemphasis  on  individual  
solutions rather than social change; and (5) they have the potential to dehumanize 
the client through labeling.
Feminist  therapists  believe  that  external  factors  and  contextual  factors  are  as  
important as internal dynamics in understanding the client’s presenting problems 
(Evans & Miller, 2016). The feminist approach emphasizes that many symptoms can 
be understood as coping or survival strategies rather than as evidence of pathology 
(Bitter, 2008; Worell & Remer, 2003). Due to the cultural and gender limitations of 
diagnoses,  Eriksen  and  Kress  (2005)  encourage  therapists  “to  be  tentative  in  diag-
nosing those from diverse backgrounds, and to, as a part of a more egalitarian rela-
tionship, co-construct an understanding of the problem with the client, rather than 
imposing a diagnosis on the client” (p. 104). Reframing symptoms as resistance to 
oppression  and  as  coping  skills  or  strategies  for  survival  and  shifting  the  etiology  
of the problem to the environment avoids “blaming the victim” for her or his prob-
lems. Assessment is viewed as an ongoing process between client and therapist and 
is connected to treatment interventions. In the feminist therapy process, diagnosis 
of distress becomes secondary to identification and assessment of strengths, skills, 
and resources (Brown, 2010).
The emphasis of feminist therapy is on wellness rather than disease, resilience 
rather  than  deficits,  and  a  celebration  of  diverse  strengths  (Brabeck  &  Brabeck,  
2013). Diagnosis, when used, results from a shared dialogue between client and ther-
apist. The counselor is careful to review with the client any implications of assigning 
a  diagnosis  so  the  client  can  make  an  informed  choice,  and  discussion  focuses  on  
helping the client understand the role of socialization and culture in the etiology of 
these problems.

Techniques and Strategies
Feminist therapy does not prescribe any particular set of interventions and tailors 
interventions to clients’ strengths with the goal of empowering clients while evok-
ing their feminist consciousness (Brown, 2010). Nonetheless, they have developed 
several unique techniques and have borrowed others from traditional approaches. 
Particularly  important  are  consciousness-raising  techniques  that  help  women  dif-
ferentiate  between  what  they  have  been  taught  is  socially  acceptable  or  desirable  
and what is actually healthy for them. Some of the techniques described by Worell 
and Remer (2003), Enns (1993, 2004), Evans, Kincade, and Seem (2011) and Evans and 
Miller (2016) are discussed in this section, using the case example of Alma to illus-
trate how these techniques might be applied.
Alma, age 22, comes to counseling reporting general anxiety about a new job she 
began a month ago. She states that she has struggled with depression off and on 
throughout her life because of bullying as a child and rejection from much of her 
family after coming out as a lesbian at age 14. Alma identifies as Dominican and 
continues to struggle with the loss of her place within her family of origin. She now 
believes coming out was a selfish mistake and is trying to make amends by keeping 
her feelings regarding her sexual and affectional orientation hidden. Due in part to 
past experiences, she is worried that if she comes out to her coworkers the company 
might find a reason to fire her. Alma says, “I would like to cut my hair short again 
because it is more manageable and I also prefer to wear what is considered to be 
more masculine clothing, but I am worried this will cause people at work to ques-
tion my femininity. I really like my job, and I worked very hard to get it. I am afraid 
if I show them who I really am, they won’t want me there anymore.”
Empowerment At the heart of feminist strategies is the goal of empowering 
the client. Feminist therapists work in an egalitarian manner and use empowerment 
strategies that are tailored to each client (Brown, 2010; Evans et al,, 2011). Alma’s 
therapist will pay careful attention to informed consent issues, discussing ways Alma 
can get the most from the therapy session, clarifying expectations, identifying goals, 
and working toward a contract that will guide the therapeutic process.
Informed consent offers a place to begin a relationship that is egalitarian and col-
laborative. By explaining how therapy works and enlisting Alma as an active partner 
in the therapeutic venture, the therapy process is demystified and Alma becomes an 
equal participant. Alma will learn that she is in charge of the direction, length, and 
procedures of her therapy. Alma’s therapist might ask her, “What is the most pow-
erful  thing  you  could  do  for  yourself  right  now?”  The  intent  of  this  question  is  to  
“interrupt the trance of powerlessness” by inviting Alma to notice how power is actu-
ally available to her (Brown, 2010, p. 35). Given Alma’s cultural background, it may be 
particularly important to address power within the therapeutic relationship because 
Alma may view the therapist as an expert who holds the answers she is seeking.
Self-Disclosure  Feminist  therapists  use  therapeutic  self-disclosure  in  the  best  
interests   of   the   client   to   equalize   the   client–therapist   relationship,   to   provide   
modeling,  to  normalize  women’s  collective  experiences,  to  empower  clients,  and  to

establish  informed  consent.  The  counselor  engages  in  self-disclosure  only  when  it  
is  judged  to  be  therapeutically  helpful  to  the  client.  For  example,  Alma’s  therapist  
may  briefly  disclose  her  own  difficulties  in  relating  to  members  of  her  family  of  
origin, acknowledging that at times hiding information seems important in order to 
keep  the  peace.  The  counselor  might  share  how  she  decides  when  and  when  not  to  
be  open  about  her  personal  life.  The  counselor  could  then  discuss  with  Alma  ways  
in  which  they  have  both  experienced  cultural  and  social  pressures  to  conform  to  a  
hetero-normative ideal. Alma benefits from this modeling by a woman who does not 
meet  society’s  expectations  for  female  behavior  and  appearance  but  is  comfortable  
with the image she has developed and how it has worked for her, not against her. The 
counselor’s disclosure would happen over time, for it is crucial that the counselor does 
not overshadow the client’s time to explore the concerns that bring her to therapy.
Self-disclosure goes beyond sharing information and experiences; it also involves 
the quality of presence the therapist brings to the therapeutic sessions. Effective ther-
apist self-disclosure is grounded in authenticity and a sense of mutuality. The thera-
pist  explains  to  Alma  the  therapeutic  interventions  that  are  likely  to  be  employed.  
Alma, as an informed consumer, will be involved in evaluating how well these strate-
gies are working and the degree to which her personal goals in therapy are being met.
Gender-Role or Social Identity Analysis A hallmark of feminist therapy, gender-
role  analysis  assists  clients  in  identifying  the  impact  that  their  own  gender-role  
socialization  has  played  in  shaping  their  values,  thoughts,  and  behaviors  (Evans  
& Miller, 2016). Some feminist therapists prefer the term “social identity analysis” 
because it reflects the importance of assessing all relevant aspects of a client’s identity, 
including  multiple  memberships  in  both  socially  disempowered  and  privileged  
groups.  For  example,  Alma  identifies  as  a  female,  a  lesbian,  and  a  Dominican—all  
marginalized identities within the dominant culture. Social identity and gender-role 
analysis  begins  with  clients  identifying  the  societal  messages  they  received  about  
how women and men should be and act as well as how these messages interact with 
other important aspects of identity (Remer, 2013). The therapist begins by asking 
Alma to identify messages she has received related to sexuality, race/ethnicity, and 
appearance  from  her  culture,  society,  her  peers,  the  media,  and  her  family.  The  
therapist talks about how body image expectations differ between females and males 
in  our  culture  and  how  they  may  differ  in  other  cultures.  The  therapist  explains  
how  expectations  related  to  appearance  could  intersect  with  beliefs  about  what  it  
means to be gay or straight in Alma’s culture, family, and society as it relates to her 
working environment. As Alma identifies the messages playing in her head and the 
voices  behind  those  messages,  she  is  living  with  a  mindfulness  of  her  internalized  
oppression. Alma decides what messages she would prefer to have in her mind and 
keeps an open awareness when the discounting messages play in her head. The goal 
is for Alma to adopt realistic and affirming internal messages.
Gender-Role Intervention Using this technique, the therapist responds to Alma’s 
concern  by  placing  it  in  the  context  of  society’s  role  expectations  for  women.  The  
aim  is  to  provide  Alma  with  insight  into  the  ways  social  issues  are  affecting  her.  
Alma’s  therapist  responds  to  her  statement  with,  “Our  society  really  focuses  on  
sometimes  unrealistic  beauty  ideals  with  females.  The  media  bombards  girls  and

women with the message that they must be thin, have long straight hair, and wear 
attractive clothing. The message is so ingrained that many girls are struggling with 
self-esteem issues related to their appearance as early as elementary school to avoid 
being  bullied  or  to  fit  in.”  By  placing  Alma’s  concern  in  the  context  of  societal  
expectations,  the  therapist  gives  Alma  insight  into  how  these  expectations  have  
affected her psychological condition and have contributed to her feeling depressed 
and  anxious  about  judgment  from  others.  The  therapist’s  statement  also  paves  
the way for Alma to think more positively about her unity with other women and 
even to think about how she might contribute as a role model for girls and young 
women in the future. Alma is increasing her awareness of the strong role media play 
in perpetuating oversexualized images of women and how those images affect her 
self-esteem. Alma may decide to begin a dialogue with other women to discuss ways 
to create significant change.
Power Analysis Power analysis refers to the range of methods aimed at helping 
clients  understand  how  unequal  access  to  power  and  resources  can  influence  
personal  realities.  Together  therapists  and  clients  analyze  how  various  forms  of  
power in the dominant and subordinate group limit self-definition and well-being 
(Enns,  2004;  Pusateri  &  Headley,  2015).  Alma  will  become  aware  of  the  power  
difference between women and men as well as the power differences associated with 
sexual orientation and ethnic status in our society. Specific issues related to Alma’s 
cultural  perspective  also  are  explored.  The  power  analysis  may  focus  on  helping  
Alma identify alternate kinds of power she may exercise and learn how to challenge 
the  gender-role  messages  that  prohibit  the  exercise  of  that  kind  of  power.  Alma  
choreographs the changes she wants to make in her life. Interventions are aimed at 
helping Alma learn to appreciate herself as she is, regain her self-confidence based 
on the personality attributes she possesses, and set goals that will be fulfilling to her 
within the context of her cultural values.
Bibliotherapy    Nonfiction    books,    psychology    and    counseling    textbooks,    
autobiographies,  self-help  books,  educational  videos,  films,  and  even  novels  can  
all  be  used  as  bibliotherapy  resources.  Reading  about  feminist  and  multicultural  
perspectives  on  common  issues  in  women’s  lives  (incest,  rape,  domestic  violence,  
and  sexual  harassment)  may  challenge  a  woman’s  tendency  to  blame  herself  for  
these  problems  (Remer,  2013).  The  therapist  describes  a  number  of  books  that  
address  issues  of  relevance  to  Alma,  and  she  selects  one  to  read  over  the  next  few  
weeks. Providing Alma with reading material increases knowledge and decreases the 
power difference between Alma and her therapist. Reading can supplement what is 
learned in the therapy sessions, and Alma can enhance her therapy by exploring her 
reactions  to  what  she  is  reading.  For  women  with  diverse  social  identities,  books,  
biographies, and memoirs written by women with similar or related identities can 
provide concrete examples of empowerment and can facilitate growth.
Assertiveness  Training  By  teaching  and  promoting  assertive  behavior,  women  
become  aware  of  their  interpersonal  rights,  transcend  stereotypical  gender  roles,  
change negative beliefs, and implement changes in their daily life. Alma may learn how 
sexism has contributed to keeping females passive. For example, a woman behaving

in  an  assertive  way  is  often  labeled  “aggressive,”  but  similar  behavior  in  a  man  may  
be viewed as “assertive.” Therapist and client consider what is culturally appropriate, 
and  the  client  decides  when  and  how  to  be  assertive,  balancing  the  potential  costs  
and benefits of assertiveness within the ecological context relevant to the client. The 
therapist helps Alma evaluate and anticipate the consequences of behaving assertively, 
which might range from criticism to actually getting what she wants.
Through learning and practicing assertive behaviors and communication, Alma 
may increase her own power, which will ameliorate her depression and anxiety. Alma 
learns that it is her right to ask for what she wants and needs in the workplace.
Reframing  and  Relabeling  Like  bibliotherapy,  therapist  self-disclosure,  and  
assertiveness  training,  reframing  is  not  unique  to  feminist  therapy.  However,  
reframing  is  applied  uniquely  in  feminist  therapy.  reframing  includes  a  shift  
from  placing  the  problem  internally  and  “blaming  the  victim”  to  a  consideration  
of  social  factors  in  the  environment  that  contribute  to  a  client’s  problem.  Rather  
than dwelling exclusively on intrapsychic factors, the focus is on examining societal 
or  political  dimensions.  Alma  may  come  to  understand  that  her  depression  and  
anxiety  are  linked  to  social  pressures  to  behave  within  hetero-normative  gender-
role expectations and to develop an appearance that matches these culturally and 
societally prescribed ideals.
relabeling  is  an  intervention  that  changes  the  label  or  evaluation  applied  to  
some behavioral characteristic. Alma can change certain labels she has attached to 
herself, such as being inadequate or socially unwanted because she does not conform 
to ideals commonly associated with femininity. An example might be that Alma is 
encouraged to talk about herself as a strong and healthy woman rather than as being 
“selfish” or too “masculine.”
Social  Action  Social  action,  or  social  activism,  is  an  essential  quality  of  
feminist  counseling  (Enns  et  al.,  2013;  Evans  et  al.,  2011;  Evans  &  Miller,  2016).  
As  clients  become  more  grounded  in  their  understanding  of  feminism,  therapists  
may suggest that clients become involved in activities such as volunteering at a rape 
crisis center, lobbying lawmakers, or providing community education about gender 
issues.  Participating  in  such  activities  can  empower  clients  and  help  them  see  the  
link between their personal experiences and the sociopolitical context in which they 
live. Alma might decide to join and participate in organizations that are working to 
change societal stereotypes about female beauty expectations for women or social 
groups  that  affirm  people  who  identify  with  a  variety  of  sexual  and  affectional  
orientations.  Participating  in  social  action  can  increase  self-esteem  and  a  sense  of  
personal power.
Group Work Feminist therapists often encourage their clients to make the 
transition from individual therapy to a group format such as joining a support group 
or  a  political  action  group  as  soon  as  this  is  realistic  (Herlihy  &  McCollum,  2011).  
Although  these  groups  are  as  diverse  as  the  women  who  comprise  them,  they  share  
a  common  denominator  emphasizing  support  for  the  experience  of  women.  The  
literature  reveals  that  women  who  join  these  groups  eventually  realize  that  they  are  
not alone and gain validation for their experiences by participating in the group. These

groups can provide women with a social network, decrease feelings of isolation, create 
an environment that encourages sharing of experiences, and help women realize that 
they are not alone in their experiences (Eriksen & Kress, 2005). Groups provide a place 
where women are valued and affirmed and where they can share and begin to critically 
explore the messages they have internalized about their self-worth and their place in 
society.  The  self-disclosures  of  both  the  members  and  the  leader  foster  deeper  self-
exploration, a sense of universality, and increased levels of cohesion. Members learn to 
use power effectively by providing support to one another, practicing behavioral skills, 
considering social/political actions, and by taking interpersonal risks in a safe setting 
(Enns, 2004). Through their group participation, women learn that their individual 
experiences  are  frequently  rooted  in  problems  within  the  system.  Participation  in  a  
group experience can inspire women to take up some form of social action. Indeed, a 
form of homework can be to carry out what women are learning in the group to bring 
about changes in their lives outside of the group.
Alma and her therapist will likely discuss the possibility of Alma joining a women’s 
support group, a gay-straight alliance, or another type of group as a part of the process 
of terminating individual therapy. Participating in a group can enhance Alma’s sense 
of community. She will witness the journey of personal and collective transformation 
and growth as she adds to her group of supporters, encouragers, and teachers. Other 
women can provide her with nurturance and support, and Alma will have the chance 
to be significant to other women as they engage in their healing process.
The Role of Men in Feminist Therapy
Men can be feminist therapists, and feminist therapy can be practiced with male cli-
ents. It is an erroneous perception that feminist therapy is conducted only by women 
and for women, or that feminist therapy is anti-men because it is pro-women (Evans 
et al., 2011; Herlihy & McCollum, 2011). Although the original feminist therapists 
were  all  women,  men  have  now  joined  their  ranks.  Male  feminist  therapists  are  
willing  to  understand  and  “own”  their  male  privilege,  confront  sexist  behavior  in  
themselves and others, redefine masculinity and femininity according to other than 
traditional values, work toward establishing egalitarian relationships, and actively 
engage in and support women’s efforts to create a just society.
The principles and practices of feminist psychotherapy are useful in working with 
male  clients,  individuals  from  diverse  racial  and  cultural  backgrounds,  and  people  
who are committed to addressing social justice issues in counseling practice (Enns, 
2004;  Worell  &  Remer,  2003).  Social  mandates  about  masculinity  such  as  restric-
tive emotionality, overvaluing power and control, the sexualization of emotion, and 
obsession with achievement can be limiting to males (Englar-Carlson, 2014).
Female counselors who work with male clients have an opportunity to create an 
accepting, authentic, and safe climate in which men can reflect on their needs, choices, 
past and present pain, and hopes for their future. By using relational-cultural theory, 
female  counselors  provide  a  forum  for  men  to  consider  the  contexts  that  helped  
shape them (Duffey & Haberstroh, 2014). Any presenting issue of male clients can be 
dealt with from a feminist perspective. For a comprehensive treatment of counseling 
men in specialized modalities and settings, intersections of identity, and specialized 
populations and concerns, see Englar-Carlson, Evans, and Duffey (2014).

Feminist Therapy From a Multicultural  
and Social Justice Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Of all the theoretical approaches to counseling and psychotherapy in this 
book, feminist therapy has the most in common with the multicultural and social 
justice  perspectives.  Historically,  multicultural  approaches  evolved  in  response  to  
societal oppression, discrimination, and marginalization faced by people of color. 
Over  time,  the  multicultural  perspective  has  made  counseling  more  inclusive.  
Contemporary counselors who infuse their work with a multicultural perspective 
address a wide variety of inequities that limit full participation in society. The social 
justice perspective in counseling aims to empower the individual as well as to con-
front injustice and inequality in society.
Although multicultural, feminist, and social justice counseling have been viewed 
as disparate models, they have many common threads (Crethar et al., 2008). All three 
approaches  emphasize  the  need  to  promote  social,  political,  and  environmental  
changes within the counseling context. Practitioners of all three perspectives strive 
to create an egalitarian relationship in which counselor and client co-construct the 
client’s problems from a contextual perspective and collaborate in setting goals and 
choosing  strategies.  All  three  approaches  reject  the  “disease  model”  of  psychopa-
thology; they view clients’ problems as symptoms of their experiences of living in an 
unjust society rather than as having an intrapsychic origin.
Feminist  therapy’s  primary  tenet,  “the  personal  is  also  the  political,”  has  been  
embraced by the multicultural and social justice perspectives. None of the perspec-
tives  rests  solely  on  individual  change;  they  all  emphasize  direct  action  for  social  
change as a part of the role of therapists. Williams and Enns (2013) encourage ther-
apists  to  become  activists  by  making  a  commitment  to  social  change:  “Make  the  
political  personal—understand  your  own  history  and  roots  and  work  to  own  your  
own privilege. Perhaps most important, you should choose to do social justice work 
for you” (p. 488).
Culture  encompasses  the  sociopolitical  reality  of  people’s  lives,  including  
how the privileged dominant group (in Western societies: males, Whites, Chris-
tians,  heterosexuals,  and  the  rich)  treats  those  who  are  different  from  them.  
Feminist therapists believe psychotherapy is inextricably bound to culture, and, 
increasingly, they are being joined by thoughtful leaders in the field of counseling 
practice.
Culturally competent feminist therapists look for ways to work within the con-
text of the client’s culture by exploring consequences and alternatives. They appre-
ciate  the  complexities  involved  in  changing  within  one’s  culture,  but  do  not  view  
culture  as  sacrosanct  (Worell  &  Remer,  2003).  It  is  important  to  understand  and  
respect  diverse  cultures,  but  most  cultural  contexts  have  both  positive  and  toxic  
aspects, and the toxic aspects that oppress and marginalize groups of people need to 
be explored. Feminist therapists are committed to taking a critical look at cultural 
beliefs and practices that discriminate against, subordinate, and restrict the poten-
tial of groups of individuals.

Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Feminist practitioners advocate for change in the social structure, especially in the areas 
of inequality, power in relationships, the right to self-determination, freedom to pursue 
a career outside or inside the home, and the right to an education. This agenda could 
pose some problems when working with women who do not share these beliefs. Remer 
(2013) acknowledges that if therapists do not fully understand and respect the cultural 
values  of  clients  from  diverse  groups,  they  run  the  risk  of  imposing  their  own  values.  
Remer  claims  “a  potential  danger  inherent  in  feminist  counseling  is  that  counselors’  
values will too strongly influence clients or will conflict with clients’ values” (p. 404).
Being aware of the cultural context is especially important when feminist thera-
pists work with women from cultures that endorse culturally prescribed roles that 
keep women in a subservient place or that are grounded in patriarchy. Consider this 
scenario.  You  are  a  feminist  therapist  working  with  a  Vietnamese  woman  who  is  
struggling to find a way to be true to her culture and also to follow her own educa-
tional and career aspirations. Your client is a student in a helping profession who is 
being subjected to extreme pressure from her father to return home and take care of 
her family. Although she wants to complete a degree and eventually help others in 
the Vietnamese community, she feels a great deal of guilt when she considers “self-
ishly” pursuing her education when her family at home needs her.
In this complex situation, the therapist is challenged to work together with the 
client  to  find  a  path  that  enables  her  to  consider  her  own  individual  goals  with-
out ignoring or devaluing her collectivistic cultural values. The therapist’s job is not 
to  take  away  her  pain  or  struggle,  or  to  choose  for  the  client,  but  to  be  present  in  
such  a  way  that  the  client  will  truly  be  empowered  to  make  significant  decisions.  
The  feminist  counselor  must  remain  aware  that  the  price  may  be  very  high  if  this  
woman  chooses  to  go  against  what  is  culturally  expected  of  her,  and  that  the  cli-
ent  is  the  one  to  ultimately  decide  which  path  to  follow.  As  can  be  seen  from  this  
example, to minimize this potential shortcoming of imposing cultural values on a 
client, it is essential that therapists understand how their own cultural perspectives 
are likely to influence their interventions with culturally diverse clients. A safeguard 
against value imposition is for feminist therapists to clearly present their values to 
clients early in the course of the counseling relationship so that clients can make an 
informed choice about continuing this relationship (Remer, 2013).
S
tan’s fear of women and his gender-role socializa-
tion experiences make him an excellent candidate 
to  benefit  from  feminist  therapy.  A  therapeutic  rela-
tionship that is egalitarian will be a new kind of experi-
ence for Stan.
Stan  has  indicated  that  he  is  willing  and  even  
eager   to   change.   Despite   his   low   self-esteem   and   
negative  self-evaluations,  he  is  able  to  identify  some  
positive  attributes.  These  include  his  determination,  
his  ability  to  articulate  his  feelings,  and  his  gift  for  
working with children. Stan knows what he wants out 
of therapy and has clear goals: to stop drinking, to feel 
better  about  himself,  to  relate  to  women  on  an  equal  
basis, and to learn to love and trust himself and others. 
Operating from a feminist orientation, I will build on 
these strengths.

356            CHAPTER TWElVE
In  the  first  session  I  focus  on  establishing  an  
egalitarian  working  relationship  to  help  Stan  begin  
to regain his personal power. It is important that the 
therapeutic relationship does not replicate other rela-
tionships  Stan  has  had  with  significant  figures  in  his  
life.  I  consciously  work  to  demystify  the  therapeutic  
process  and  equalize  the  relationship,  conveying  to  
Stan that he is in charge of the direction of his therapy. 
I spend time explaining my view of the therapy process 
and how it works.
A  gender-role  analysis  is  conducted  to  help  Stan  
become aware of the influence of gender-role expecta-
tions in the development of his problems. First, I ask 
him to identify gender-role messages he received while 
growing up from his parents, teachers, the media, faith 
community, and peers. In his autobiography Stan has 
written  about  some  of  the  messages  his  parents  gave  
him, and this provides a natural starting point for his 
analysis. He remembers his father calling him “dumb” 
and  his  mother  saying,  “Why  can’t  you  grow  up  and  
be  a  man?”  Stan  wrote  about  his  mother  “continu-
ally  harping  at”  his  father  and  telling  Stan  how  she  
wished she hadn’t had him. He describes his father as 
weak, passive, and mousy in relating to his mother and 
remembers that his father compared him unfavorably 
with  his  siblings.  Stan  internalized  these  messages,  
often crying himself to sleep and feeling very hopeless.
I ask Stan to identify the damaging self-statements 
he  makes  now  that  are  based  on  these  early  experi-
ences. As we review his writings, Stan sees how societal 
messages  he  received  about  what  a  man  “should”  be  
were reinforced by parental messages and have shaped 
his  view  of  himself  today.  For  example,  he  wrote  that  
he  feels  sexually  inadequate.  It  appears  that  he  has  
introjected the societal notion that men should always 
initiate sex, be ready for sex, and be able to achieve and 
sustain an erection. Stan also sees that he has already 
identified and written about how he wants to change 
those  messages,  as  exemplified  in  his  statements  that  
he wants to “feel equal with others” and not “feel apol-
ogetic” for his existence and develop a loving relation-
ship  with  a  woman.  Stan  begins  to  feel  capable  and  
empowered  as  I  acknowledge  the  important  work  he  
has already done, even before he entered therapy.
I  follow  this  gender-role  analysis  with  a  gender-
role  intervention  to  place  Stan’s  concerns  in  the  con-
text of societal role expectations.
Therapist: Indeed, it is a burden to try to live up to so-
ciety’s notion of what it means to be a man, always 
having to be strong and tough. Sometimes real 
strength comes through our vulnerability. Those 
aspects of yourself that you would like to value—
your ability to experience your feelings, being good 
with children—are qualities society tends to label as 
“‘feminine.”
Stan:  [replies wistfully] Yeah, it would be a better world 
if women could be strong without being seen as 
domineering and if men could be sensitive and 
nurturing without being seen as weak.
Therapist:
 Are you sure that’s not possible? Have you 
ever met a woman or a man who was like that?
Stan  ponders  for  a  minute  and  then  with  some  ani-
mation  describes  the  college  professor  who  taught  
his  Psychology  of  Adjustment  class.  Stan  saw  her  as  
very  accomplished  and  strong,  but  also  as  someone  
who  empowered  him  by  encouraging  him  to  find  his  
own voice through writing his autobiography. He also 
remembers  a  male  counselor  at  the  youth  rehabilita-
tion facility where he spent part of his adolescence as 
a man who was strong as well as sensitive and nurtur-
ing. I ask Stan if there are other people in his life now 
who  might  support  his  efforts  to  be  more  accepting  
and affirming of his androgyny.
As  the  first  session  draws  to  a  close,  I  invite  Stan  
to talk about what he learned from our time together. 
Stan  says  two  things  stand  out  for  him.  First,  he  is  
beginning to believe he doesn’t need to keep blaming 
himself.  He  knows  that  many  of  the  messages  he  has  
received from his parents and from society about what 
it means to be a man have been undesirable and one-
dimensional.  He  acknowledges  that  he  has  been  lim-
ited  and  constrained  by  his  gender-role  socialization.  
Second, he feels hopeful because there are alternatives 
to  those  parental  and  societal  definitions—people  he  
admires have been able to successfully combine “mas-
culine” and “feminine” traits. If they can do it, so can 
he. I ask Stan whether he chooses to return for another 
session. When he answers in the affirmative, I give him 
W. S. Pollack’s (1998) book Real Boys to read. I explain 
that  this  book  descriptively  captures  the  gender-role  
socialization that many boys experience.
Stan comes to the following session eager to talk 
about his homework assignment. He tells me that he

gained  some  real  insights  into  his  own  attitudes  and  
beliefs  by  reading  Real  Boys.  What  Stan  learned  from  
reading this book leads to a further exploration of his 
relationship  with  his  mother.  He  finds  it  helpful  to  
understand his parents’ behavior in the context of soci-
etal expectations and stereotypes rather than continu-
ing to blame them. I help Stan to see how our culture 
tends to hold extreme positions about mothers—that 
they  are  either  perfect  or  wicked—and  that  neither  of  
these  extremes  is  true.  We  talk  briefly  about  what  he  
has learned about mothers as saints or sinners. As Stan 
learns to reframe his relationship with his mother, he 
develops  a  more  realistic  picture  of  her.  He  comes  to  
realize,  too,  that  his  father  has  been  oppressed  by  his  
own socialization experiences and by an idealistic view 
of masculinity that he may have felt unable to achieve.
Stan  continues  to  work  at  learning  to  value  the  
nurturing and sensitive aspects of himself. He is learn-
ing to value the “feminine” as well as the “masculine” 
aspects  of  his  personality.  He  continues  to  monitor  
and make changes in his self-talk about what it means 
to be a man. He is gaining awareness of these messages 
that come from current sources such as the media and 
friends,  and  each  day  he  adds  to  his  journal,  noting  
how these messages are transmitted and the ways that 
he is challenging them.
Throughout   our   therapeutic   relationship,   we   
discuss  with  immediacy  how  we  are  communicating  
and  relating  to  each  other  during  the  sessions.  I  am  
self-disclosing and treat Stan as an equal, continually 
acknowledging that he is the “expert” on his life.
Questions for Reflection
What unique values do you see in working with 
Stan from a feminist perspective as opposed to 
working from the other therapeutic approaches 
you’ve studied thus far?
If you were to continue working with Stan, what 
self-statements regarding his view of himself as a 
man might you focus on, and what alternatives 
might you offer?
In what ways could you integrate cognitive behav-
ior therapy with feminist therapy in Stan’s case? 
What possibilities do you see for integrating 
Gestalt therapy methods with feminist therapy? 
What other therapies might you combine with a 
feminist approach?
  Visit CengageBrain.com or watch the video pro-
gram  for  Theory  and  Practice  of  Counseling  and  Psy-
chotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes, session 
10 (feminist therapy), for a demonstration of my 
approach  to  counseling  
stan  from  this  perspec-
tive.  This  session  deals  with  stan’s  exploration  
of  his  gender-role  identity  and  messages  he  has  
incorporated about being a man.
P
owerlessness is the theme I hear from Gwen at the 
beginning of this session. She talks about her sad-
ness  in  seeing  her  granddaughter  going  through  the  
same  things  she  experienced  as  a  young  girl.  Gwen  
feels invisible and unappreciated. I want to help Gwen 
become aware of how gender-role socialization has in-
fluenced her and help her reclaim her personal power.
Gwen: I can’t tell you how many times in one day I tell 
myself that I’m not worth anything.
Therapist: Give me an example of something that 
happens to you and the message you hear inside 
yourself.
Gwen: Well, in a meeting at work with the partners, I 
may make a suggestion about something we might 
do, but I’m ignored. Then Joe, this White guy, 
makes the same suggestion with just a little twist 
and the partners are all over it.
Therapist: So your voice is ignored, but the White 
man gets heard. What do you tell yourself?
Gwen: I get really angry! If I say something, I am 
accused of “always making it about race.” Then  
I say to myself, “they are right because most of 
the time it is about race.” I usually think, “here 
we go again!”

Therapist: Even though you push back against their 
message, a part of you believes them—that you 
are making too big a deal out of your voice being 
ignored.
Gwen: No, I don’t believe that. Some things are about 
being a woman of color and not being heard, and 
that’s just how it is. Society ignores it, but it is real. 
When someone does not know what it’s like to be 
invisible and unheard, they are privileged! This is 
an old, tired story for me.
Therapist: What did you learn growing up about the 
value of your voice and your value as a girl and a 
young woman?
Gwen:
 I learned that boys were valued more than girls. 
I received the message that being a girl meant you 
were not strong enough, not smart enough, and 
that you were required to be in the kitchen cleaning 
up after a meal.
I asked Gwen to write a gender-role analysis before 
our  next  session.  In  it  she  provides  more  information  
about  the  gender-role  expectations  in  her  home  and  in  
her community as she was growing up. Gwen also writes 
about telling an adult that her older cousin had touched 
her inappropriately. She was told to be quiet about the 
situation,  and  her  sexual  abuse  was  never  spoken  of  
again. Gwen learned early that her voice did not matter. 
In this session, I work toward validating her experiences 
and the value of her voice. I acknowledge her pain and let 
her know that society has perpetuated this unequal and 
devaluing view of women and girls globally.
Therapist: Gwen, I read your gender-role analysis 
thoroughly, and I really appreciate you trusting me 
with the information you shared.
Gwen: It was hard.
Therapist: I’m sure it was. I was especially struck with 
how early in your life you learned a lesson that too 
many girls learn—that your voice didn’t count and 
that your body was not yours. I am so sorry that 
you had the experience of sexual abuse as a child  
[It is important to name the reality of her experience and 
not side-step it].
Gwen:
 I don’t think I realized until this moment what a 
strong message was sent to me that day—the day I tried 
to share with my mother what had happened to me.
Therapist: What message did you receive?
Gwen:
 My mother said, “Are you sure that happened? 
I think you are making it up to get him in trouble!”
Therapist: In a culture where males are valued more 
than females and where males have much more 
power than females, the response you got from 
your mother is often given directly or indirectly to 
girls and women when they tell their truth about 
being abused.
Gwen:
 I thought my mother would believe me and 
would support me.
Therapist: You were and still are disappointed because 
your mother, a person you trusted, silenced you. 
And you’re confused about why she, as a woman, 
would do this.
Gwen: Yes, I am.
Therapist: Keep in mind that your mother was raised 
in the same culture in which the men are raised. 
Women hear the same messages discounting  
females that the men hear.
Gwen:
 You know, at work I get more angry at the 
women than at the men. When I’m being discount-
ed and being told that I’m too angry and using the 
“race card,” I rage more at the women than I do at 
the men.
Therapist: What do you think that is about?
Gwen: Perhaps it is that I’m more disappointed in the 
women for not standing with me. Or perhaps, like 
my mother, I value the men more. It really hurts me 
to believe that might be true.
By placing Gwen’s issue in a larger societal context, she 
begins to understand that her experiences resonate with 
the experiences of other women. It helps her to under-
stand that she, too, might be working from a model of 
males being valued more than females. If she can get a 
clear  understanding  of  this,  she  can  move  more  easily  
to a place of truly believing in her own value.
Gwen is a professional woman with an MBA from 
a  prestigious  university.  She  has  had  to  continuously  
negotiate  minefields  of  racism,  sexism,  and  multiple  
forms  of  inequality.  Institutional  racism  perpetuates  
the  oppression  she  has  experienced  and  continues  to  
experience,  but  she  sees  that  using  her  voice  might  
begin  the  process  of  healing  her  personal  wounds

from  this  societal  injustice.  I  discuss  with  Gwen  the  
potential risks of using her voice (becoming more out-
spoken) in her present professional environment.
Gwen: I’m really tired of feeling angry all the time, but 
I can tell you I’m also really tired of being treated as 
“less than.”
Therapist:
 Tell me more about your experiences of 
being treated as less than.
Gwen: If I raise my voice or express frustration at 
work—even if I’m not angry—I am told that I’m too 
emotional and too angry. I really feel that I’ve been 
labeled “the angry black woman,” and no matter 
how appropriate I am with my frustration or with 
my voice, it is always seen as “there goes that angry 
black woman again.”
Therapist: So, people at work have written this story 
about you—angry black woman—and many things 
that you do are filtered through the lens of that 
story.
Gwen: Yes, that’s right.
Therapist:
 Think about the times when you are ap-
propriately speaking your mind and sharing your 
frustration. Tell me what words you use to describe 
yourself.
Gwen:  [pause] Sometimes I am angry, and I have a 
right to be, but I would say that I am being passion-
ate and assertive.
Therapist:
 I really like that! How might it be for you 
to make sure that you restate in your own head 
that message: “Gwen, you are being passionate and 
assertive.” This is a way to define yourself.
Gwen:
 It is definitely something I would like to do.
Therapist: You have walked a path cluttered with 
micro-aggressions for over 50 years, sometimes 
experiencing these toxic messages multiple times 
a day. As a woman of color, you are bombarded 
with the messages from a culture that devalues 
people of color and women. We can draw on the 
strength of those who came before us. We are 
standing on the shoulders of those who fought 
for our rights as people of color and as women. 
We know there is injustice in the fabric of our 
society. What will you do to make changes that 
are important to you?
Gwen:  [Listening intently and reflecting on ways she has been 
slighted] It feels good to talk about all this.
Therapist: You are an intelligent, passionate, creative, 
and strong woman. I’m wondering how you might 
use these parts of you to design your life to be more 
the way you want it to be.
Gwen: I’m not sure. I do know that I want to be more 
proactive in my community and more patient with 
my mother. I’m learning that I still hold resent-
ments from my childhood, and I want to let  
that go.
Therapist: That sounds like a good place to start.
Gwen:
 I also want to make sure that I handle my voice 
and my frustration in the workplace appropriately. 
I want my voice to be heard. Perhaps I can assert-
ively ask not to be interrupted when folks start to 
interrupt me. When someone else is getting credit 
for my idea, I will remind them that I had shared 
it earlier. I will ask why it wasn’t heard when I pre-
sented it. I could do this calmly, but consistently.
Therapist: I think that is an excellent idea.
Gwen  has  been  sitting  on  the  curb  of  her  life  
watching  the  traffic  go  by  for  far  too  long.  She  does  
not realize her own strength to create change. I share 
with  Gwen  some  of  my  challenges  with  racism.  My  
self-disclosure  is  intended  to  join  with  her  in  affirm-
ing that her experience of oppression is, in fact, valid. 
As Gwen hears that she is not alone and that she can 
begin to stand up and use her authentic voice, it is my 
hope  that  Gwen  will  realize  she  can  join  with  others  
to  make  some  change  in  society  through  conscious  
action.
I   collaborate   with   Gwen   in   identifying   her   
resources  and  deciding  how  she  can  make  fuller  use  
of  them  in  daily  life.  I  become  an  ally  and  supporter  
as she begins to create a plan of action for social and 
personal transformation.
Therapist: You have shared some of the ways that you 
want to be more visible in your work environment 
and more assertive in your daily living. You have 
also shared some ways that you plan on engaging 
with your mother differently. I’m wondering if 
there are any social groups you could become part 
of that would help you feel more connected and

involved in the community? Do you know some 
other women who are also strong and with whom 
you could find and offer support?
Gwen: There is a women’s group in my church that is 
made up of professional women. I’ve avoided being 
a part of it because I’m so busy and because I was 
afraid that I wouldn’t fit in. There is one woman 
in the group I trust, and I think I will talk with her 
about ways I’m trying to restructure my life and see 
if she thinks the group would be a good fit for me.
Therapist: So, she would serve for a while like your 
mirror. She could reflect how she perceives you as 
you interact with these women.
Gwen:
 I wasn’t thinking of it exactly in that way. It 
will just feel good to have someone in the group 
who I know and feel comfortable with.
As we continue our discussions in future sessions, 
my goal is to help Gwen reclaim her power, increase her 
self-esteem, and ultimately reach her full potential as 
a valuable and significant member of her community.
Questions for Reflection
What reactions do you have to the therapist’s 
interventions with Gwen?
What differences do you see when working with 
Gwen from a feminist perspective rather than 
from other theoretical frameworks?

self-disclosure?
What are potential dangers for Gwen if she 
increasingly speaks her mind in professional 
settings?
Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Feminist  therapy  largely  grew  out  of  the  recognition  by  women  that  the  
traditional models of therapy suffer from basic limitations due to the inherent bias 
of earlier White male theoreticians. Feminist therapy emphasizes these concepts:
Viewing problems in a sociopolitical and cultural context rather than 
on an individual level
Recognizing that clients are experts on their own lives
Striving to create a therapeutic relationship that is egalitarian through 
the process of self-disclosure and informed consent
Demystifying the therapeutic process by including the client as much 
as possible in all phases of assessment and treatment, which increases 
client empowerment
Viewing women’s and other marginalized and oppressed group’s experi-
ences from a unique perspective
Understanding that gender never exists in isolation from other aspects 
of identity
Understanding and appreciating the lives and perspectives of diverse 
women and other marginalized and oppressed groups
Challenging traditional ways of assessing the psychological health of 
women and other marginalized and oppressed groups
Emphasizing the role of the therapist as advocate as well as facilitator
Encouraging clients to get involved in social action to address oppres-
sive aspects of the environment

Section 372

fEMInIsT THERAPY         361 
The feminist approach is aimed at both personal and social change. The theo-
retical orientation is continually evolving and maturing. The major goal is to replace 
the current patriarchal system with feminist consciousness and thus create a soci-
ety  that  values  equality  in  relationships,  values  diversity,  stresses  interdependence  
rather than dependence, and encourages both women and men to define themselves 
rather than being defined by societal stereotypes.
Feminist practice tends to be diverse because it has been developed and expanded 
by multiple voices. As the feminist approach has matured, it has become more self-
critical and varied. Feminist therapists and other therapists who infuse their work 
with multicultural and social justice perspectives share a number of basic assump-
tions  and  roles:  they  engage  in  appropriate  self-disclosure;  they  make  their  values  
and beliefs explicit so that the therapy process is clearly understood; they establish 
egalitarian roles with clients; they work toward client empowerment; they emphasize 
the  commonalities  among  women  and  other  marginalized  and  oppressed  groups  
while  honoring  their  diverse  life  experiences;  and  they  all  have  an  agenda  to  bring  
about social change.
Feminist  practitioners  are  committed  to  actively  breaking  down  the  hierarchy  
of  power  in  the  therapeutic  relationship  through  the  use  of  various  interventions.  
Some of these strategies are unique to feminist therapy, such as gender-role analy-
sis and intervention, power analysis, assuming a stance of advocate in challenging 
conventional  attitudes  toward  appropriate  roles  for  women,  and  encouraging  cli-
ents  to  take  social  action.  Other  therapeutic  strategies  are  borrowed  from  various  
therapy  models,  including  bibliotherapy,  assertiveness  training,  cognitive  restruc-
turing, reframing and relabeling, counselor self-disclosure, role playing, identifying 
and  challenging  untested  beliefs,  and  journal  writing.  Feminist  therapy  principles  
and techniques can be applied to a range of therapeutic modalities such as individ-
ual therapy, couples counseling, family therapy, group counseling, and community 
intervention. Regardless of the specific techniques used, the overriding goals are cli-
ent empowerment and social transformation.
Contributions of Feminist Therapy and Multicultural and  
Social Justice Perspectives
One  of  the  major  contributions  feminist  theorists  and  practitioners  have  made  to  
the field of counseling and psychotherapy is paving the way for gender-sensitive prac-
tice  and  an  awareness  of  the  impact  of  the  cultural  context  and  multiple  oppres-
sions.  By  focusing  attention  on  our  attitudes  and  biases  pertaining  to  gender  and  
culture, feminist therapists have expanded the awareness of therapists of all theoreti-
cal orientations regarding how social justice issues may touch clients. A significant 
contribution  of  feminist  therapy  is  the  emphasis  on  social  change,  which  can  lead  
to  a  transformation  in  society.  Feminist  therapists  have  brought  about  significant  
theoretical and professional advances in counseling practice. Some of these contri-
butions  include  power  sharing  with  clients,  cultural  critiques  of  both  assessment  
and treatment approaches, and the validation of women and their normative experi-
ences.  Feminist  therapists  have  also  made  important  contributions  by  questioning  
the androcentricity of traditional counseling theories and models of human develop-
ment. Most theories place the cause of problems within individuals rather than with

external  circumstances  and  the  environment.  This  has  led  to  holding  individuals  
fully responsible for their problems and not giving recognition to social and political 
realities that create problems. A key contribution feminist theorists and practitioners 
continue  to  make  is  reminding  all  of  us  that  the  proper  focus  of  therapy  includes  
addressing oppressive factors in society rather than expecting individuals to merely 
adapt to expected role behaviors. This emphasis on social justice issues has expanded 
the role of therapists to be advocates for clients. For a discussion of adaptations to 
traditional approaches to counseling women, see Enns (2003).
Another major contribution of the feminist movement is in the area of ethics in 
psychology and counseling practice (Brabeck & Brabeck, 2013). The unified feminist 
voice  called  attention  to  the  extent  and  implications  of  child  abuse,  incest,  rape,  
sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Feminists pointed out the consequences 
of  failing  to  recognize  and  take  action  when  children  and  women  were  victims  of  
physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.
Feminist  therapists  demanded  action  in  cases  of  sexual  misconduct  at  a  time  
when male therapists misused the trust placed in them by their female clients. Not 
too  long  ago  the  codes  of  ethics  of  all  the  major  professional  organizations  were  
silent on the matter of therapist and client sexual liaisons. Now, virtually all of the 
professional codes of ethics prohibit sexual intimacies with current clients and with 
former clients for a specified time period. Furthermore, the professions agree that a 
sexual relationship cannot later be converted into a therapeutic relationship. Largely 
due to the efforts and input of women on ethics committees, the existing codes are 
explicit with respect to sexual harassment and sexual relationships with clients, stu-
dents, and supervisees (Herlihy & Corey, 2015b).
Feminist theory has been applied to supervision, teaching, consultation, ethics, 
research, and theory building as well as to the practice of psychotherapy. Building 
community,  providing  authentic  mutual  empathic  relationships,  creating  a  sense  
of social awareness, and addressing social injustices are all significant strengths of 
this approach.
The principles and techniques of feminist therapy can be incorporated in many 
other contemporary therapy models and vice versa. Both feminist and Adlerian ther-
apists  view  the  therapeutic  relationship  as  egalitarian.  Both  feminist  and  person-
centered  therapists  agree  on  the  importance  of  therapist  authenticity,  modeling,  
and  self-disclosure;  empowerment  is  the  basic  goal  of  both  orientations.  When  it  
comes to making choices about one’s destiny, existential and feminist therapists are 
speaking the same language—both emphasize choosing for oneself instead of living 
a life determined by societal dictates.
Although feminist therapists have been critical of psychoanalysis as a sexist ori-
entation, a number of feminist therapists believe psychoanalysis can be an appropri-
ate approach to helping women. Object-relations theory may help clients examine 
internalized object representations that are based on their relationships with their 
parents. Indeed, relational-cultural therapy has roots in object-relations theory. Psy-
chodynamic  approaches  might  include  an  examination  of  unconscious  learning  
about women’s roles through the mother–daughter relationship to provide insights 
into why gender roles are so deeply ingrained and difficult to change.
Cognitive behavioral therapies and feminist therapy are compatible in that they 
view the therapeutic relationship as a collaborative partnership, with the client being

in  charge  of  setting  goals  and  selecting  strategies  for  change.  These  approaches  are  
committed to demystifying therapy, and both aim to help clients take charge of their 
own  lives.  Both  the  cognitive  behavior  therapist  and  the  feminist  therapist  assume  
a  range  of  information-giving  and  teaching  functions  so  clients  can  become  active  
partners  in  the  therapy  process.  A  feminist  therapist  could  employ  action-oriented  
strategies, such as assertiveness training and behavioral rehearsal, and suggest home-
work  assignments  for  clients  to  practice  in  their  everyday  lives.  A  useful  source  for  
further discussion of feminist cognitive behavior therapy is Worell and Remer (2003).
Limitations and Criticisms of Feminist Counseling
Feminist therapists need to identify any sources of bias and work toward restructur-
ing or eliminating biased aspects in any theories or techniques they employ. This is 
indeed a demanding endeavor, and it may involve the counselor’s own therapeutic 
work  and  work  with  a  consultant.  It  is  possible  for  feminist  therapists  to  unduly  
influence clients, especially those who lack a strong sense of their own values. Femi-
nist therapists must remain aware of their own values pertaining to individual and 
social change and explicitly share these values with clients in an appropriate, timely, 
and respectful manner to reduce the risk of value imposition.
Feminist therapists call attention to clients’ unexamined choices, and they must 
honor  clients’  choices  as  long  as  those  choices  are  indeed  informed.  Once  clients  
understand the impact of gender and cultural factors on their choices, the therapist 
must guard against providing specific directions for client growth. Feminist thera-
pists are committed to helping clients weigh the costs and benefits of their current 
life  choices  but  should  not  push  clients  too  quickly  toward  changes  they  feel  are  
beyond  their  reach.  Lenore  Walker  (1994)  raised  this  issue  with  regard  to  working  
with  abused  women.  Although  Walker  focuses  on  the  importance  of  asking  ques-
tions that enable women to think through their situations in new ways and of help-
ing women develop “safety plans,” she emphasizes how critical it is to understand 
those factors in a woman’s life that often pose difficulties for her in making changes.
Looking  at  contextual  or  environmental  factors  that  contribute  to  a  woman’s  
problems and moving away from exploring the intrapsychic domain can be both a 
strength and a limitation. Instead of being blamed for her depression, the client is 
able to come to an understanding of external realities that are indeed oppressive and 
are contributing to her state of depression. A client can make some internal changes 
even in those circumstances where external realities may largely be contributing to 
her problems. Therapists must balance an exploration of the outer and inner worlds 
of the client if the client is to find a way to take action in her own life.
Factors that inhibit the growth of feminist therapy include training that is often 
offered only sporadically in a nonsystematic way (Brown, 2010) and the lack of qual-
ity control. No credentialing organization confers official status as a qualified feminist 
therapist, so formalized training and credentialing need to be addressed in the future. 
In addition, evidence-based research on the efficacy of feminist therapy is lacking, as is 
an understanding of feminist therapy as an integrative approach that can inform ther-
apeutic  practice  for  counselors  of  varied  theoretical  orientations.  Feminist  and  most  
other social justice psychotherapies do integrate evidenced-based treatment approaches 
(e.g., CBT and trauma-focused interventions) within a social justice value system.

Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What key concepts or principles of feminist therapy could you incor-
porate in your counseling practice regardless of your theoretical 
orientation?
2. Feminist therapists engage in self-disclosure only when it is judged 
to be therapeutically helpful to the client. How could you assess the 
degree to which your personal disclosures are appropriate, timely, and 
helpful to your client?
3.
 Feminist therapy aims to include social change as well as individual 
change. How competent will you be in facilitating work with your cli-
ents in the area of social action?
4.
 This approach to therapy places value on exploring issues of power, 
privilege, oppression, and discrimination. Do you see yourself as being 
primarily interested in exploring these facets with your clients?
5.
 A number of feminist therapy techniques are described in this chapter. 
What one technique do you find particularly interesting? Why?
Where to Go From Here
The DVD for Integrative Counseling: The Case of Ruth and Lecturettes is especially useful as 
a demonstration of interventions I make with Ruth that illustrate some principles 
and procedures of feminist therapy. For example, in Session 1 (“Beginning of Coun-
seling”) I ask Ruth about her expectations and initiate the informed consent pro-
cess. I attempt to engage Ruth as a collaborative partner in the therapeutic venture, 
and I teach her how counseling works. Clearly, Ruth is the expert on her own life, 
and my job is to assist her in attaining the goals we collaboratively identify as a focus 
of therapy. In Session 4 (“Understanding and Dealing With Diversity”) Ruth brings 
up gender differences, and she also mentions our differences in religion, education, 
culture, and socialization. Ruth and I explore the degree to which she feels comfort-
able with me and trusts me.

Recommended Supplementary Readings
Feminist  Perspectives  in  Therapy:  Empowering  Diverse  
Women (Worell & Remer, 2003) is an outstanding text 
that  clearly  outlines  the  foundations  of  empower-
ment in feminist therapy. The book covers a range of 
topics such as integrating feminist and multicultural 
perspectives  on  therapy,  changing  roles  for  women,  
feminist views of counseling practice, feminist trans-
formation  of  counseling  theories,  and  a  feminist  
approach  to  assessment  and  diagnosis.  There  also  
are  excellent  chapters  dealing  with  depression,  sur-
viving sexual assault, confronting abuse, choosing a 
career path, and lesbian and ethnic minority women.
Oxford Handbook of Feminist Multicultural Counseling 
Psychology  (Enns  &  Williams,  2013)  is  a  26-chapter  
handbook  that  integrates  feminist  and  multicul-
tural  scholarship  and  applies  the  perspective  to  a  
variety of women’s diverse identities related to race/
ethnicity,  social  class,  disability,  religion,  culture,  
and  so  forth.  Multiple  chapters  focus  on  the  prac-
tice  of  feminist  multicultural  therapy,  pedagogy,  
mentoring, and social advocacy.
Psychological  Practice  With  Women:  Guidelines,  Diver-
sity,   Empowerment   (Enns,   Rice,   &   Nutt,   2015)   
discusses the assessment of women’s social identities 
and diversity and features chapters that focus on psy-
chotherapy  with  African  American  women;  Latinas;  
Asian American and Pacific Islander women; Native 
women;  lesbian,  bisexual,  and  transgender  women;  
women  with  disabilities;  and  women  in  transna-
tional  practice.  Each  chapter  includes  the  applica-
tion  of  the  APA  (2007)  Guidelines  through  one  or  
more case studies.
Feminist Therapy (Brown, 2010) provides an interest-
ing  perspective  on  the  history  of  feminist  therapy  
and  speculates  about  future  developments  of  the  
approach.  Brown  clearly  explains  key  concepts  of  
feminist theory and the therapeutic process.
Introduction  to  Feminist  Therapy:  Strategies  for  Social  
and  Individual  Change  (Evans,  Kincade,  &  Seem,  
2011)   emphasizes   the   practical   applications   of   
feminist  theory  to  clinical  practice.  They  provide  
useful  information  on  social  change  and  empow-
erment,  the  importance  of  establishing  an  egali-
tarian   relationship,   and   intervention   strategies   
when  working  with  people  from  diverse  cultural  
backgrounds.

Some Contemporary Founders of Postmodern Therapies
The postmodern approaches do not have a single founder. Rather, it has been a col-
lective effort by many. I have highlighted two cofounders of solution-focused brief 
therapy and two cofounders of narrative therapy who have had a major impact on 
the development of these therapeutic approaches. These cofounders are introduced 
at the beginning of the sections on these therapies.
Introduction to Social Constructionism
Each of the models of counseling and psychotherapy we have studied so far 
has its own version of “reality.” The simultaneous existence of multiple and often 
conflicting “truths” has led to increasing skepticism that a singular, universal the-
ory will one day explain human behavior and the systems in which we live. We have 
entered a postmodern world, and truth and reality are often now understood as rep-
resenting points of view bounded by history and context rather than being objec-
tive, immutable facts.
Modernists  believe  in  the  ability  to  describe  objective  reality  accurately  and  
assume  that  it  can  be  observed  and  systematically  known  through  the  scientific  
method. They further believe reality exists independent of any attempt to observe it. 
Modernists believe people seek therapy for a problem when they have deviated too 
far from some objective norm. For example, clients may think they are abnormally 
depressed when they experience sadness for longer than they think is normal. They 
might then seek help to return to “normal” behavior.
Postmodernists, in contrast, do not believe realities exist independent of obser-
vational  processes  and  of  the  language  systems  within  which  they  are  described.  
social  constructionism  is  a  psychological  expression  of  this  postmodern  world-
view; it values the client’s reality without disputing whether it is accurate or rational 
(Gergen, 1991, 1999; Weishaar, 1993). To social constructionists, any understanding 
of reality is based on the use of language and is largely a function of the situations 
in which people live. Our knowledge about realities is socially constructed. A person 
is  depressed  when  he  or  she  adopts  a  definition  of  self  as  depressed.  Without  the  
cultural  conditions  that  accept  the  concept  of  depression,  talking  about  a  person  
as depressed would mean nothing. Once a definition of self is adopted, it is hard to 
recognize behaviors counter to that definition; for example, it is hard for someone 
who is suffering from depression to acknowledge the value of a periodic good mood 
in his or her life.
In postmodern thinking, forms of language and the use of language in stories 
create meaning. There may be as many meanings as there are people to tell the sto-
ries, and each of these stories expresses a truth for the person telling it. Even science 
is not free from the influence of such processes of social construction. Every person 
involved  in  a  situation  has  a  perspective  on  the  “reality”  of  that  situation,  but  the  
range of truths is limited due to the effects of specific historical events and the lan-
guage uses that dominate particular social contexts. In practice, therefore, the range 
of possible meanings is not infinite. When Kenneth Gergen (1985, 1991, 1999) and 
others began to emphasize the ways in which people make meaning in social rela-
tionships, the field of social constructionism was born.

In social constructionism the therapist disavows the role of expert, preferring a 
more collaborative or consultative stance. Clients are viewed as experts about their 
own lives. De Jong and Berg (2013) put this notion about the therapist’s task well:
We do not view ourselves as expert at scientifically assessing client problems and 
then  intervening.  Instead,  we  strive  to  be  expert  at  exploring  clients’  frames  of  
reference  and  identifying  those  perceptions  that  clients  can  use  to  create  more  
satisfying lives. (p. 19)
The collaborative partnership in the therapeutic process is considered more impor-
tant  than  assessment  or  technique.  Understanding  narratives  and  deconstructing  
language  processes  (discourses)  are  the  focus  for  both  understanding  individuals  
and helping them construct desired change.
Social constructionist theory is grounded on the premise that knowledge is con-
structed  through  social  processes.  What  we  consider  to  be  “truth”  is  a  product  of  
interactions  between  people  in  daily  life.  Thus  there  is  not  a  single  or  “right”  way  
to  live  one’s  life  or  to  understand  the  world.  Social  constructionism  explains  how  
values are transmitted through language by the social milieu and suggests that indi-
viduals  are  constantly  changing  with  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the  influences  of  family,  
culture, and society (Neukrug, 2016).

Historical Glimpse of Social Constructionism
A mere hundred years ago, Freud, Adler, and Jung were part of a major para-
digm shift that transformed psychology as well as philosophy, science, medicine, and 
even the arts. In the 21st century, postmodern constructions of alternative knowl-
edge  sources  seem  to  be  one  of  the  paradigm  shifts  most  likely  to  affect  the  field  
of psychotherapy. Postmodernist thought is influencing the development of many 
psychotherapy theories and contemporary psychotherapeutic practice. The creation 
of the self, which so dominated the modernist search for human essence and truth, 
is being replaced with the concept of socially storied lives. Diversity, multiple frame-
works, and integration—collaboration of the knower with the known—are all part of 
this new social movement, which provides a wider range of perspectives in counsel-
ing practice. For some social constructionists, the process of “knowing” includes a 
distrust of the dominant cultural positions that permeate families and society today 
(White & Epston, 1990), particularly when the dominant culture exerts a destructive 
impact on the lives of those who live beyond the margins of what is generally consid-
ered normal. Change begins by deconstructing the power of cultural narratives and 
then proceeds to the co-construction of a new life of meaning.
Among  the  best-known  postmodern  perspectives  on  therapy  practice  are  the  
collaborative language systems approach (Anderson & Goolishian, 1992), solution-
focused brief therapy (de Shazer, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994), solution-oriented therapy 
(Bertolino  &  O’Hanlon,  2002;  O’Hanlon  &  Weiner-Davis,  2003),  narrative  therapy  
(White & Epston, 1990), and feminist therapy (Brown, 2010). The next section exam-
ines  the  collaborative  language  systems  approach,  but  the  heart  of  this  chapter

addresses  two  of  the  most  significant  postmodern  approaches:  solution-focused  
brief therapy and narrative therapy.
The Collaborative Language Systems Approach
When people seek therapy, they are often “stuck” in a dialogic system that has 
a unique language, meaning, and process related to “the problem.” Therapy is another 
conversational  system  that  becomes  therapeutic  through  its  “problem-organizing,  
problem-dissolving”  nature  (Anderson  &  Goolishian,  1992,  p.  27).  It  is  therapists’  
willingness to enter the therapeutic conversation from a “not-knowing” position that 
facilitates this caring relationship with the client. In the not-knowing position, therapists 
still retain all of the knowledge and personal, experiential capacities they have gained 
over years of living, but they allow themselves to enter the conversation with curiosity 
and  with  an  intense  interest  in  discovery.  The  aim  here  is  to  enter  a  client’s  world  as  
fully as possible. Clients become the experts who are informing and sharing with the 
therapist the significant narratives of their lives. The not-knowing position is empathic 
and is most often characterized by questions that “come from an honest, continuous 
therapeutic posture of not understanding too quickly” (Anderson, 1993, p. 331).
Based on the referral or intake process, the therapist enters the session with some 
sense of what the client may wish to address. The questions the therapist asks are 
informed by the answers the client-expert has provided. The client’s answers provide 
information that stimulates the interest of the therapist, still in a posture of inquiry, 
and another question proceeds from each answer given. The process is similar to the 
Socratic method without any preconceived idea about how or in which direction the 
development of the stories should go. The intent of the conversation is not to con-
front or challenge the narrative of the client but to facilitate the telling and retelling 
of the story until opportunities for new meaning and new stories develop: “Telling 
one’s story is a representation of experience; it is constructing history in the present” 
(Anderson & Goolishian, 1992, p. 37). By staying with the story, the therapist–client 
conversation  evolves  into  a  dialogue  of  new  meaning,  constructing  new  narrative  
possibilities. This not-knowing position of the therapist has been infused as a key 
concept for both the solution-focused and the narrative therapeutic approaches.

INSOO  KIM  BERG  (1935–2007)  was  a  
Korean-born   American   psychothera-
pist and a pioneer of solution-focused 
brief   therapy   (SFBT).   In   1978   she   
and   her   husband,   Steve   de   Shazer,   
cofounded  the  Brief  Family  Therapy  
Center  in  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  As  
a  leader  in  the  practice  of   SFBT,  she  
provided   workshops   in   the   United   
States,  Japan,  South  Korea,  Australia,  
Denmark,    England,    and    Germany.    
Berg   published   10   groundbreaking   
books  that  elucidated  the  application  
of  SFBT  in  a  wide  variety  of  clinical  set-
tings;  among  them  are  Family  Based  Ser-
vices:  A  Solution-Focused  Approach  (1994),  
Working    With    the    Problem    Drinker:    A    
Solution-Focused  Approach  (Berg  &  Miller,  
1992),  and  Interviewing  for  Solutions  (De  
Jong  &  Berg,  2013).  Berg’s  colleagues  
described  her  as  inspiring,  humble,  and  
passionate.  She  was  committed  to  her  
work  and  rarely  took  time  off,  but  she  
did enjoy a wide range of physical activi-
ties:  stretching  exercises,  yoga,  walking,  
and gardening.

Solution-Focused Brief Therapy
Introduction
solution-focused  brief  therapy  (SFBT)  is  a  future-focused,  goal-oriented  thera-
peutic  approach  to  brief  therapy  developed  initially  by  Steve  de  Shazer  and  Insoo  
Kim Berg at the Brief Family Therapy Center in Milwaukee in the early 1980s. SFBT 
emphasizes strengths and resiliencies of people by focusing on exceptions to their 
problems and their conceptualized solutions. SFBT is an optimistic, antidetermin-
istic, future-oriented approach based on the assumption that clients have the ability 
to  change  quickly  and  can  create  a  problem-free  language  as  they  strive  for  a  new  
reality (Neukrug, 2016).
Key Concepts
Unique  Focus  of  SFBT  The  solution-focused  philosophy  rests  on  the  
assumption that people can become mired in unresolved past conflicts and blocked 
when  they  focus  on  past  or  present  problems  rather  than  on  future  solutions.  
Solution-focused  brief  therapy  differs  from  traditional  therapies  by  eschewing  
the past in favor of both the present and the future (Franklin, Trepper, Gingerich, 
&  McCollum,  2012).  Therapists  focus  on  what  is  possible,  and  they  have  little  or  
no  interest  in  gaining  an  understanding  of  how  the  problem  emerged.  Behavior  
change  is  viewed  as  the  most  effective  approach  to  assisting  people  in  enhancing  
their  lives.  De  Shazer  (1988,  1991)  suggests  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  know  the  
cause of a problem to solve it and that there is no necessary relationship between 
the causes of problems and their solutions. Assessing problems is not necessary for 
change  to  occur.  If  knowing  and  understanding  problems  are  unimportant,  so  is  
searching  for  “right”  or  absolute  solutions.  Any  person  might  consider  multiple  
solutions, and what is right for one person may not be right for others.
It is within the scope of SFBT practice to allow for some discussion of present-
ing  problems  to  validate  clients’  experience  and  to  let  them  describe  their  pain,  
STEVE   de   SHAZER   (1940–2005)   was   
one of the pioneers of solution-focused 
brief  therapy.  For  many  years  he  was  
the   director   of   research   at   the   Brief   
Family  Therapy  Center  in  Milwaukee,  
where   solution-focused   brief   therapy   
was  developed.  He  wrote  several  books  
on  SFBT,  including  Keys  to  Solutions  in  
Brief  Therapy  (1985),  Clues:  Investigating  
Solutions  in  Brief  Therapy  (1988),  Putting 
Difference to Work (1991), and Words Were 
Originally Magic (1994).
De  Shazer  loved  baseball,  was  a  
gourmet cook, and made time for long daily walks. 
Some  of  his  leisure  pursuits  included  
reading  philosophy  tracts  in  the  origi-
nal  German  or  French,  listening  to  jazz,  
and   perusing   esoteric   cookbooks.   He   
was  trained  as  a  classical  musician  and  
played  several  instruments  at  a  profes-
sional  level.  During  his  youth  he  made  
his  living  as  a  jazz  saxophonist.  He  pre-
sented   workshops,   trained,   and   con-
sulted widely in North America, Europe, 
Australia, and Asia. While on a teaching 
tour  in  Europe  in  2005,  de  Shazer  went  
to a hospital in Vienna for medical help; 
he died several hours after being admitted.

struggles,  and  frustrations  (Murphy,  2013,  2015).  However,  this  brief  exploration  
differs from the lengthy discourse into the history and causes of problems common 
to some other types of therapy. In solution-focused brief therapy, clients choose the 
goals they wish to accomplish; little attention is given to diagnosis, history taking, 
or exploring the emergence of the problem (O’Hanlon & Weiner-Davis, 2003).
Positive Orientation Solution-focused brief therapy is grounded on the optimistic 
assumption that people are healthy and competent and have the ability to construct 
solutions  that  can  enhance  their  lives.  An  underlying  assumption  of  SFBT  is  that  
we  already  have  the  ability  to  resolve  the  challenges  life  brings  us,  but  at  times  
we  lose  our  sense  of  direction  or  our  awareness  of  our  competencies.  Regardless  
of  what  shape  clients  are  in  when  they  enter  therapy,  solution-focused  therapists  
believe  clients  are  competent.  The  therapist’s  role  is  to  help  clients  recognize  the  
competencies  they  already  possess  and  apply  them  toward  solutions.  The  essence  
of  therapy  involves  building  on  clients’  hope  and  optimism  by  creating  positive  
expectations  that  change  is  possible.  Solution-focused  brief  therapy  has  parallels  
with positive psychology, which concentrates on what is right and what is working 
for  people  rather  than  dwelling  on  deficits,  weaknesses,  and  problems  (Murphy,  
2015).  By  emphasizing  positive  dimensions,  clients  quickly  become  involved  in  
resolving their problems, which makes this a very empowering approach.
Because  clients  often  come  to  therapy  in  a  “problem-oriented”  state,  even  the  
few  solutions  they  have  considered  are  wrapped  in  the  power  of  the  problem  ori-
entation. Clients often have a story that is rooted in a deterministic view that what 
has happened in their past will certainly shape their future. Solution-focused practi-
tioners counter this negative client presentation with optimistic conversations that 
highlight a belief in achievable and usable goals. Therapists can be instrumental in 
assisting  clients  in  making  a  shift  from  a  fixed  problem  state  to  a  world  with  new  
possibilities. One of the goals of SFBT is to shift clients’ perceptions by reframing 
what White and Epston (1990) refer to as clients’ problem-saturated stories through the 
counselor’s skillful use of language.
Looking  for  What  Is  Working  The  emphasis  of  SFBT  is  to  focus  on  what  is  
working  in  clients’  lives,  which  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the  traditional  models  
of  therapy  that  tend  to  be  problem-focused.  Individuals  bring  stories  to  therapy,  
some  of  which  are  used  to  justify  the  client’s  belief  that  life  can’t  be  changed  or,  
worse, that life is moving them further and further away from their goals. Solution-
focused brief therapists assist clients in paying attention to the exceptions to their 
problem  patterns,  or  their  instances  of  success.  They  promote  hope  by  helping  
clients discover exceptions, or times when the problem is less intrusive in their life 
(Metcalf, 2001). SFBT focuses on finding out what people are doing that is working 
and then helping them apply this knowledge to eliminate problems in the shortest 
amount  of  time  possible.  Identifying  what  is  working  and  encouraging  clients  
to  replicate  these  patterns  is  extremely  important  (Murphy,  2015).  A  key  theme  
of  SFBT  is,  When  you  know  what  is  working,  do  more  of  it.  If  something  is  not  
working, try something different (Hoyt, 2015).
There  are  various  ways  to  assist  clients  in  thinking  about  what  has  worked  
for  them.  De  Shazer  (1991)  prefers  to  engage  clients  in  conversations  that  lead  to

progressive  narratives  whereby  people  create  situations  in  which  they  can  make  
steady  gains  toward  their  goals.  De  Shazer  might  say,  “Tell  me  about  times  when  
you felt a little better and when things were going your way.” It is in these stories of 
life worth living that the power of problems is deconstructed and new solutions are 
manifest and made possible.
Basic  Assumptions  Guiding  Practice  Walter  and  Peller  (1992,  2000)  think  of  
solution-focused therapy as a model that explains how people change and how they 
can reach their goals rather than a model of the causes of problems. Here are some 
of their basic assumptions about solution-focused therapy:
Individuals who come to therapy do have the capability of behaving 
effectively, even though this effectiveness may be temporarily blocked 
by negative cognitions. Problem-focused thinking prevents people from 
recognizing effective ways they have dealt with problems.
There are advantages to a positive focus on solutions and on the future. 
If clients can reorient themselves in the direction of their strengths 
using solution-talk, there is a good chance therapy can be brief.
There are exceptions to every problem, or times when the problem 
was absent. By talking about these exceptions, clients can get clues to 
effective solutions and can gain control over what had seemed to be an 
insurmountable personal difficulty. Rapid changes are possible when 
clients identify exceptions to their problems and begin to organize their 
thinking around these exceptions instead of around the problem.
Clients often present only one side of themselves. Solution-focused thera-
pists invite clients to examine another side of the story they are presenting.
No problem is constant, and change is inevitable. What people need to do 
is become aware of any positive changes that are happening. Small changes 
pave the way for larger changes, and these changes are often all that is needed 
to resolve the problems clients bring to counseling (Guterman, 2013).
Clients are doing their best to make change happen. Therapists should 
adopt a cooperative stance with clients rather than devising strategies 
to control resistive patterns. When therapists find ways to cooperate 
with people, resistance does not occur.
Clients can be trusted in their intention to solve their problems. Thera-
pists assume that clients want to change, can change, and will change 
under cooperative and empowering therapeutic conditions. There are 
no “right” solutions to specific problems that can be applied to all peo-
ple. Each individual is unique and so, too, is each solution.
Characteristics of Brief Therapy The average length of therapy is three to eight 
sessions,  with  the  most  common  length  being  only  one  session  (Hoyt,  2015).  The  
main goal of brief therapy is to help clients efficiently resolve problems and to move 
forward as quickly as possible. Some of the defining characteristics of brief therapy 
include the following (Hoyt, 2009, 2011, 2015):
Rapid working alliance between therapist and client
Clear specification of achievable treatment goals

Clear division of responsibilities between client and therapist, with 
active client participation and a high level of therapist activity
Emphasis on client’s strengths, competencies, and adaptive capacities
Expectation that change is possible and realistic and that improvement 
can occur in the immediate future
Here-and-now orientation with a primary focus on current functioning 
in thinking, feeling, and behaving
Specific, integrated, pragmatic, and eclectic techniques

Time sensitive, including making the most of each session and ending

The core task is for SFBT practitioners to learn how to rapidly and systemati-
cally identify problems, create a collaborative relationship with clients, and intervene 
with  a  range  of  specific  methods.  Because  most  therapy  is  time-limited,  therapists  
should learn to practice brief therapy well (Hoyt, 2011).
The Therapeutic Process
The therapeutic process rests on the foundation that clients are the experts on their 
own  lives  and  often  have  a  good  sense  of  what  has  or  has  not  worked  in  the  past  
and  what  might  work  in  the  future.  Solution-focused  counseling  assumes  a  col-
laborative approach with clients in contrast to the educative stance that is typically 
associated  with  most  traditional  models  of  therapy.  If  clients  are  involved  in  the  
therapeutic process from beginning to end, the chances are increased that therapy 
will  be  successful.  In  short,  collaborative  and  cooperative  relationships  tend  to  be  
more effective than hierarchical relationships in therapy.
De  Shazer  (1991)  believes  clients  can  generally  build  solutions  to  their  prob-
lems  without  any  assessment  of  the  nature  of  their  problems.  Given  this  frame-
work, the structure of solution building differs greatly from traditional approaches 
to problem solving as can be seen in this brief description of the steps involved 
(De Jong & Berg, 2013):
1.
 Clients are given an opportunity to describe their problems. The thera-
pist listens respectfully and carefully as clients answer the therapist’s 
question, “How can I be useful to you?”
2.
 The therapist works with clients in developing well-formed goals as 
soon as possible. The question is posed, “What will be different in your 
life when your problems are solved?”
3. The therapist asks clients about those times when their problems were 
not present or when the problems were less severe. Clients are assisted 
in exploring these exceptions, with special emphasis on what they did 
to make these events happen.
4.
 At the end of each solution-building conversation, the therapist offers 
clients summary feedback, provides encouragement, and suggests 
what clients might observe or do before the next session to further 
solve their problem.

5. The therapist and clients evaluate the progress being made in reaching 
satisfactory solutions by using a rating scale. Clients are asked what 
needs to be done before they see their problem as being solved and also 
what their next step will be.
Therapeutic Goals SFBT reflects some basic notions about change, about interaction, 
and  about  reaching  goals.  The  solution-focused  therapist  believes  people  have  
the  ability  to  define  meaningful  personal  goals  and  that  they  have  the  resources  
required to solve their problems. Goals are unique to each client and are constructed 
by  the  client  to  create  a  richer  future  (Prochaska  &  Norcross,  2014).  A  lack  of  
clarity regarding client preferences, goals, and desired outcomes can result in a rift 
between  therapist  and  client.  During  the  early  phase  of  therapy,  it  is  important  
that clients be given the opportunity to express what they want from therapy and 
what concerns they are willing to explore. From the first contact with clients, the 
therapist strives to create a climate that will facilitate change and encourage clients 
to think in terms of a range of possibilities.
Solution-focused therapists concentrate on small, realistic, achievable changes 
that can lead to additional positive outcomes. Because success tends to build upon 
itself, modest goals are viewed as the beginning of change. The therapist looks for 
ways to amplify the client’s movement in the desired direction as quickly as possible 
(Hoyt, 2015). Solution-focused therapists use questions such as these that presup-
pose change, posit multiple answers, and remain goal-directed and future-oriented: 
“What did you do, and what has changed since last time?” or “What did you notice 
that went better?” (Bubenzer & West, 1993).
Murphy (2015) emphasizes the importance of assisting clients in creating well-
defined  goals  that  are  (1)  stated  positively  in  the  client’s  language;  (2)  are  action-
oriented; (3) are structured in the here and now; (4) are attainable, concrete, specific, 
and  measurable;  and  (5)  are  controlled  by  the  client.  Counselors  should  not  too  
rigidly  impose  an  agenda  of  getting  precise  goals  before  clients  have  a  chance  to  
express  their  concerns.  Clients  must  feel  that  their  concerns  are  heard  and  under-
stood before they can formulate meaningful personal goals. In a therapist’s zeal to 
be  solution-focused,  it  is  possible  to  get  lost  in  the  mechanics  of  therapy  and  not  
attend sufficiently to the interpersonal aspects. Therapists need to be mindful of not 
becoming overly technique driven at the expense of the therapeutic alliance.
Solution-oriented  therapy  offers  several  forms  of  goals:  changing  the  viewing 
of  a  situation  or  a  frame  of  reference,  changing  the  doing  of  the  problematic  situ-
ation,  and  tapping  client  strengths  and  resources  (O’Hanlon  &  Weiner-Davis,  2003).  
Therapists note the language they use, so they can increase their clients’ hope and 
optimism and their openness to possibilities and change. Clients are encouraged to 
engage  in  change-  or  solution-talk,  rather  than  problem-talk,  on  the  assumption  
that what we talk about most will be what we produce. Talking about problems can 
produce ongoing problems. Talk about change can produce change.
Therapist’s Function and Role Solution-focused practitioners believe that every 
client is motivated in the sense that he or she wants something as a consequence of 
meeting with a therapist (George, Iveson, & Ratner, 2015). Clients are much more

likely to get involved in the therapeutic process if they believe they are determining 
the direction and purpose of the conversation. Much of what the therapeutic process 
is  about  involves  clients’  thinking  about  their  future  and  what  they  want  to  be  
different in their lives. Consistent with the postmodern and social constructionist 
perspective, solution-focused brief therapists adopt a not-knowing position to put clients 
in the position of being the experts about their own lives. Therapists do not assume 
that  by  virtue  of  their  expert  frame  of  reference  they  know  the  significance  of  the  
client’s actions and experiences (Anderson & Goolishian, 1992). This model casts the 
role and function of a therapist in quite a different light from traditionally oriented 
therapists who view themselves as experts in assessment and treatment. The therapist-
as-expert is replaced by the client-as-expert, especially when it comes to what the client 
wants in life and in therapy. It is important that therapists actually believe that their 
clients  are  the  true  experts  on  their  own  lives.  Although  therapists  have  expertise  in  
the process of change, clients are the experts on what they want changed. Clients will 
have their own ways of building their preferred futures, even if this is often not clear to 
them when they begin therapy. The therapist’s task is to point clients in the direction 
of change without dictating what to change (George et al., 2015; Guterman, 2013).
Therapists  strive  to  create  a  climate  of  mutual  respect,  dialogue,  and  affirma-
tion in which clients experience the freedom to create, explore, and coauthor their 
evolving stories. A key therapeutic task consists of helping clients imagine how they 
would like life to be different and what it would take to make this transformation 
happen. One of the functions of the therapist is to ask questions and, based on the 
answers, generate further questions. Examples of some useful questions are “What 
do you hope to gain from coming here?” “If you were to make the changes you desire, 
how would that make a difference in your life?” and “What steps can you take now 
that will lead to these changes?”
The  Therapeutic  Relationship  The  quality  of  the  relationship  between  
therapist and client is a determining factor in the outcomes of SFBT, so relationship 
building  or  engagement  is  a  basic  step  in  SFBT.  The  attitude  of  the  therapist  is  
crucial  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  therapeutic  process.  It  is  essential  to  create  a  
sense of trust so clients will return for further sessions and will follow through on 
homework  suggestions.  The  therapeutic  process  works  best  when  clients  become  
actively  involved,  when  they  experience  a  positive  relationship  with  the  therapist,  
and when counseling addresses what clients see as being important (Murphy, 2015). 
One way of creating an effective therapeutic partnership is for the therapist to show 
clients how they can use the strengths and resources they already have to construct 
solutions.  Clients  are  encouraged  to  do  something  different  and  to  be  creative  in  
thinking about ways to deal with their present and future concerns.
De  Shazer  (1988)  has  described  three  kinds  of  relationships  that  may  develop  
between therapists and their clients:
1.
 Customer: the client and therapist jointly identify a problem and a solu-
tion to work toward. The client realizes that to attain his or her goals, 
personal effort will be required.

to assume a role in constructing a solution, believing that a solution

is dependent on someone else’s actions. In this situation, the client 
generally expects the therapist to change the other person to whom the 
client attributes the problem.
3. Visitor: the client comes to therapy because someone else (a spouse, par-
ent, teacher, or probation officer) thinks the client has a problem. This 
client may not agree that he or she has a problem and may be unable to 
identify anything to explore in therapy.
De  Jong  and  Berg  (2013)  recommend  using  caution  so  that  therapists  do  not  
box clients into static identities. These three roles are only starting points for con-
versation.  Rather  than  categorizing  clients,  therapists  can  reflect  on  the  kinds  of  
relationships that are developing between their clients and themselves. For example, 
clients who tend to place the cause of their problems on another person or persons 
in  their  lives  (complainants)  may  be  helped  by  skilled  intervention  to  begin  to  see  
their own role in their problems and the necessity for taking active steps in creating 
solutions. How the therapist responds to different behaviors of clients has a lot to 
do with bringing about a shift in the relationship. In short, both complainants and 
visitors have the capacity for becoming customers.
Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
Some  of  the  key  techniques  that  solution-focused  practitioners  are  likely  
to  employ  include  looking  for  differences  in  doing,  exception  questions,  scaling  
questions, and the miracle question. If these techniques are used in a routine way 
without developing a collaborative working alliance, they will not lead to effective 
results. Murphy (2015) reminds us that these solution-focused techniques should 
be  used  flexibly  and  tailored  to  the  unique  circumstances  of  each  client.  Therapy  
is  best  guided  by  the  client’s  goals,  perceptions,  resources,  and  feedback.  Therapy  
should not be determined by any absolutes or rigid standards outside the therapeu-
tic relationship (namely, evidence-based treatments).
Pretherapy Change Simply scheduling an appointment often sets positive change 
in  motion.  During  the  initial  therapy  session,  it  is  common  for  solution-focused  
therapists  to  ask,  “What  have  you  done  since  you  called  for  the  appointment  that  
has  made  a  difference  in  your  problem?”  (de  Shazer,  1985,  1988).  By  asking  about  
such  changes,  the  therapist  can  elicit,  evoke,  and  amplify  what  clients  have  already  
done by way of making positive change. These changes cannot be attributed to the 
therapy process itself, so asking about them tends to encourage clients to rely less on 
their therapist and more on their own resources to accomplish their treatment goals.
Exception  Questions  SFBT  is  based  on  the  notion  that  there  were  times  in  
clients’ lives when the problems they identify were not problematic. These times are 
called exceptions  and  represent  news  of  difference  (Bateson,  1972).  Solution-focused  
therapists  ask  exception  questions  to  direct  clients  to  times  when  the  problem  
did  not  exist,  or  when  the  problem  was  not  as  intense.  
exceptions  are  those  past  
experiences  in  a  client’s  life  when  it  would  be  reasonable  to  have  expected  the  
problem  to  occur,  but  somehow  it  did  not  (de  Shazer,  1985;  Murphy,  2015).

By helping clients identify and examine these exceptions, the chances are increased 
that  they  will  work  toward  solutions  (Guterman,  2013).  Once  identified  by  an  
individual, these instances of success can be useful in making further changes. This 
exploration reminds clients that problems are not all-powerful and have not existed 
forever;  it  also  provides  a  field  of  opportunity  for  evoking  resources,  engaging  
strengths,  and  positing  possible  solutions.  The  therapist  asks  clients  what  has  to  
happen for these exceptions to occur more often.
The  Miracle  Question  Therapy  goals  are  developed  by  using  what  de  Shazer  
(1988) calls the miracle question, which is a main SFBT technique. The therapist 
asks, “If a miracle happened and the problem you have was solved overnight, how 
would  you  know  it  was  solved,  and  what  would  be  different?”  Clients  are  then  
encouraged to enact “what would be different” in spite of perceived problems. If a 
client asserts that she wants to feel more confident and secure, the therapist might 
say: “Let yourself imagine that you leave the office today and that you are on track 
to  acting  more  confidently  and  securely.  What  will  you  be  doing  differently?”  This  
process of considering hypothetical solutions reflects O’Hanlon and Weiner-Davis’s 
(2003) belief that changing the doing and viewing of the perceived problem changes 
the problem.
De Jong and Berg (2013) identify several reasons the miracle question is a useful 
technique. Asking clients to consider that a miracle takes place opens up a range of 
future possibilities. Clients are encouraged to allow themselves to dream as a way of 
identifying the kinds of changes they most want to see. This question has a future 
focus in that clients can begin to consider a different kind of life that is not domi-
nated by a particular problem. This intervention shifts the emphasis from both past 
and current problems toward a more satisfying life in the future.
Scaling Questions Solution-focused therapists also use scaling questions when 
change  in  human  experiences  are  not  easily  observed,  such  as  feelings,  moods,  
or  communication,  and  to  assist  clients  in  noticing  that  they  are  not  completely  
defeated by their problem (de Shazer & Berg, 1988). For example, a woman reporting 
feelings of panic or anxiety might be asked: “On a scale of zero to 10, with zero being 
how you felt when you first came to therapy and 10 being how you feel the day after 
your  miracle  occurs  and  your  problem  is  gone,  how  would  you  rate  your  anxiety  
right now?” Even if the client has only moved away from zero to 1, she has improved. 
How  did  she  do  that?  What  does  she  need  to  do  to  move  another  number  up  the  
scale? Scaling questions enable clients to pay closer attention to what they are doing 
and how they can take steps that will lead to the changes they desire.
Formula First Session Task    The    formula first session task (FFST) is a form of 
homework a therapist might give clients to complete between their first and second 
sessions. The therapist might say: “Between now and the next time we meet, I would 
like you to observe, so that you can describe to me next time, what happens in your 
(family, life, marriage, relationship) that you want to continue to have happen” (de 
Shazer, 1985, p. 137). At the second session, clients can be asked what they observed 
and  what  they  would  like  to  have  happen  in  the  future.  This  kind  of  assignment  
offers clients hope that change is inevitable. It is not a matter of if change will occur,

but when it will happen. According to de Shazer, this intervention tends to increase 
clients’  optimism  and  hope  about  their  present  and  future  situation.  The  FFST  
technique emphasizes future solutions rather than past problems (Murphy, 2015).
Therapist  Feedback  to  Clients  Solution-focused  practitioners  generally  take  a  
break  of  5  to  10  minutes  toward  the  end  of  each  session  to  compose  a  summary  
message  for  clients.  During  this  break  therapists  formulate  feedback  that  will  be  
given to clients after the break. The summary might contain strengths the therapist 
has  noticed  about  the  client  during  the  session,  signs  of  hope  and  identifying  
exceptions to a problem, and a commentary on what the client is already doing that 
is useful in moving in a desired direction (George et al., 2015).
De Jong and Berg (2013) describe three basic parts to the structure of the sum-
mary feedback: compliments, a bridge, and suggesting a task. Compliments are genu-
ine  affirmations  of  what  clients  are  already  doing  that  is  leading  toward  effective  
solutions. It is important that complimenting is not done in a routine or mechani-
cal way, but in an encouraging manner that creates hope and conveys the expecta-
tion  to  clients  that  they  can  achieve  their  goals  by  drawing  on  their  strengths  and  
successes. Second, a bridge links the initial compliments to the suggested tasks that 
will be given. The bridge provides the rationale for the suggestions. The third aspect 
of feedback consists of suggesting tasks to clients, which can be considered as home-
work. Observational tasks ask clients to simply pay attention to some aspect of their 
lives. This self-monitoring process helps clients note the differences when things are 
better,  especially  what  was  different  about  the  way  they  thought,  felt,  or  behaved.  
Behavioral  tasks  require  that  clients  actually  do  something  the  therapist  believes  
would be useful to them in constructing solutions. De Jong and Berg (2013) stress 
that a therapist’s feedback to clients addresses what they need to do more of and do 
differently in order to increase the chances of obtaining their goals.
Terminating From the very first solution-focused interview, the therapist is mindful 
of  working  toward  termination.  Once  clients  are  able  to  construct  a  satisfactory  
solution, the therapeutic relationship can be terminated. The initial goal-formation 
question  that  a  therapist  often  asks  is,  “What  needs  to  be  different  in  your  life  as  a  
result of coming here for you to say that meeting with me was worthwhile?” Through 
the use of scaling questions, therapists can assist clients in monitoring their progress 
so clients can determine when they no longer need to come to therapy (De Jong & Berg, 
2013). Establishing clear goals from the beginning of therapy lays the groundwork for 
effective termination (Murphy, 2015). Prior to ending therapy, therapists assist clients 
in identifying things they can do to continue the changes they have already made into 
the  future.  Clients  can  also  be  helped  to  identify  hurdles  or  perceived  barriers  that  
could get in the way of maintaining the changes they have made.
Guterman (2013) maintains that the ultimate goal of solution-focused counsel-
ing  is  to  end  treatment.  He  adds,  “If  counselors  are  not  proactive  in  making  their  
treatment  brief  by  design,  then  in  many  cases  counseling  will  be  brief  by  default”  
(p. 104). Because this model of therapy is brief, present-centered, and addresses spe-
cific complaints, it is very possible that clients will experience other developmental 
concerns at a later time. Clients can be invited to ask for additional sessions when-
ever they feel a need to get their life back on track or to update their story.

Dr.  John  Murphy  puts  many  SFBT  techniques  into  action  as  he  illustrates  
assessment  and  treatment  from  a  solution-focused  brief  therapy  approach  in  the  
case of Ruth in Case Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 11).
Application to Group Counseling The solution-focused group practitioner 
believes  that  people  are  competent,  and  that  given  a  climate  where  they  can  
experience their competency, they are able to solve their own problems, enabling 
them  to  live  a  richer  life.  From  the  beginning,  the  group  facilitator  sets  a  tone  
of  focusing  on  solutions  (Metcalf,  1998)  in  which  group  members  are  given  an  
opportunity  to  describe  their  problems  briefly.  A  facilitator  might  begin  a  new  
group by requesting, “I would like each of you to introduce yourself. As you do, 
give us a brief idea as to why you are here and tell us what you would like for us 
to  know  about  you.”  Facilitators  help  members  to  keep  the  problem  external  in  
conversations, which tends to be a relief because it gives members an opportunity 
to  see  themselves  as  less  problem-saturated.  It  is  the  facilitator’s  role  to  create  
opportunities for the members to view themselves as being resourceful. Because 
SFBT is designed to be brief, the leader has the task of keeping group members on 
a solution track rather than a problem track, which helps members to move in a 
positive direction.
The  group  leader  works  with  members  in  developing  well-formed  goals  as  
soon as possible. Leaders concentrate on small, realistic, achievable changes that 
may  lead  to  additional  positive  outcomes.  Because  success  tends  to  build  upon  
itself, modest goals are viewed as the beginning of change. Questions used to assist 
members in formulating clear goals might include “What will be different in your 
life  when  each  of  your  problems  is  solved?”  and  “What  will  be  going  on  in  the  
future that will tell you and the rest of us in the group that things are better for 
you?” Sometimes members talk about what others will be doing or not doing and 
forget to pay attention to their own goals or behavior. At times such as this they 
can be asked, “And what about yourself? What will you be doing differently in that 
picture? As a result of your doing things differently, how would you imagine oth-
ers responding to you?”
The facilitator asks members about times when their problems were not present 
or when the problems were less severe. The members are assisted in exploring these 
exceptions,  and  special  emphasis  is  placed  on  what  they  did  to  make  these  events  
happen.  The  participants  engage  in  identifying  exceptions  with  each  other.  This  
improves the group process and promotes a solution focus, which can become quite 
powerful. Exceptions are real events that take place outside of the problem context. 
In individual counseling, only the therapist and the client are observers of compe-
tency. An advantage of group counseling is that the audience widens and more input 
is possible (Metcalf, 1998).
The art of questioning is a main intervention used in solution-focused groups. 
Questions  are  asked  from  a  position  of  respect,  genuine  curiosity,  sincere  interest,  
and  openness.  Group  leaders  use  questions  such  as  these  that  presuppose  change  
and  remain  goal-directed  and  future-oriented:  “What  did  you  do  and  what  has  
changed since last time?” or “What did you notice that went better?” Other group 
members are encouraged to respond along with the group leader to promote group

interaction.  Facilitators  may  pose  questions  like  these:  “Someday,  when  the  prob-
lems  that  brought  you  to  this  group  are  less  problematic  to  you,  what  will  you  be  
doing?” “As each of you listened to others today, is there someone in our group who 
could be a source of encouragement for you to do something different?” The leader 
is attempting to help the members identify exceptions and begin to recognize per-
sonal  resiliency  and  competency.  Creating  a  group  context  in  which  the  members  
are able to learn more about their personal abilities is key to members learning to 
resolve their own concerns.
Solution-focused group counseling offers a great deal of promise for practitio-
ners  who  want  a  practical  and  time-effective  approach  to  interventions  in  school  
settings. As a cooperative approach, SFBT shifts the focus from what’s wrong in stu-
dents’ lives to what’s working for them (Murphy, 2015; Sklare, 2005). Rather than 
being  a  cookbook  of  techniques  for  removing  students’  problems,  this  approach  
offers  school  counselors  a  collaborative  framework  aimed  at  achieving  small,  con-
crete  changes  that  enable  students  to  discover  a  more  productive  direction.  This  
model has much to offer to school counselors who are responsible for serving large 
caseloads  of  students  in  a  K–12  school  system.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  
SFBT in groups, see Corey (2016, chap. 16).

Narrative Therapy
Introduction
Of all the social constructionists, Michael White and David Epston (1990) are best 
known  for  their  use  of  narrative  in  therapy.  According  to  White  (1992),  individu-
als  construct  the  meaning  of  life  in  interpretive  stories,  which  are  then  treated  as  
“truth.”  Because  of  the  power  of  dominant  culture  narratives,  individuals  tend  to  
internalize the messages from these dominant discourses, which often work against 
the life opportunity of the individual.
Adopting  a  postmodern,  narrative,  social  constructionist  view  sheds  light  on  
how power, knowledge, and “truth” are negotiated in families and other social and 
cultural contexts (Freedman & Combs, 1996). Narrative therapy is a strengths-based 
approach that emphasizes collaboration between client and therapist to help clients 
view themselves as empowered and living the way they want (Rice, 2015).
Key Concepts
The  key  concepts  and  therapeutic  process  sections  are  adapted  from  sev-
eral different works, but primarily from these sources: Winslade and Monk (2007), 
Monk  (1997),  Winslade,  Crocket,  and  Monk  (1997),  McKenzie  and  Monk  (1997),  
and Freedman and Combs (1996).
Focus  of  Narrative  Therapy  The  narrative  approach  involves  adopting  a  shift  
in  focus  from  most  traditional  theories.  Therapists  are  encouraged  to  establish  a  
collaborative approach with a special interest in listening respectfully to clients’ stories; 
to  search  for  times  in  clients’  lives  when  they  were  resourceful;  to  use  questions  as  a  
way to engage clients and facilitate their exploration; to avoid diagnosing and labeling 
clients  or  accepting  a  totalizing  description  based  on  a  problem;  to  assist  clients  in  
mapping  the  influence  a  problem  has  had  on  their  lives;  and  to  assist  clients  in  
separating themselves from the dominant stories they have internalized so that space 
can be opened for the creation of alternative life stories (Freedman & Combs, 1996).
The  Role  of  Stories  One  of  the  theoretical  underpinnings  of  narrative  therapy  
is  the  notion  that  problems  are  manufactured  in  social,  cultural,  and  political  
contexts. We live our lives by the stories we tell about ourselves and that others tell 
about us. Our stories shape reality in that they construct and constitute what we see, 
feel, and do. The stories we live by grow out of conversations in a social and cultural 
context. Change occurs by exploring how language is used to create and maintain 
problems  (Rice,  2015).  Therapy  clients  have  vivid  stories  to  recount.  When  stories  
are changed, not only is the person telling the story changed but the therapist who 
is privileged to be a part of this unfolding process is also changed (Monk, 1997).
Listening With an Open Mind All social constructionist theories emphasize listening 
to  clients  without  judgment  or  blame,  affirming  and  valuing  them.  Narrative  
practice  goes  further  in  deconstructing  the  systems  of  normalizing  judgment  that  
are found in medical, psychological, and educational discourse. Normalizing judgment 
is any kind of judgment that locates a person on a normal curve and is used to assess

intelligence,  mental  health,  or  normal  behavior.  Because  these  kinds  of  judgments  
claim to be objective measures, they are difficult for individuals to resist and usually 
are  internalized.  Narrative  therapists  argue  that  suspending  personal  judgment  is  
of  little  value  if  you  participate  in  normalizing  judgment.  Deconstruction  involves  
turning  the  tables  and  asking  what  clients  think  of  the  judgments  they  have  been  
assigned. Narrative practitioners might be said to invite people to pass judgment on 
the  judgments  that  have  been  working  them  over.  Narrative  therapists  help  clients  
modify their painful beliefs, values, and interpretations as clients create meaning and 
new  possibilities  from  the  stories  they  share.  Therapists  do  not  impose  their  value  
system, and interpretations flow from clients’ stories rather than from a preconceived 
and ultimately imposed theory of importance and value.
Narrative therapists strive to listen to the problem-saturated story of the client 
without getting stuck. Therapists stay alert for details that give evidence of the cli-
ent’s competence in taking stands against oppressive problems. Winslade and Monk 
(2007)  maintain  that  the  therapist  believes  the  client’s  abilities,  talents,  positive  
intentions, and life experiences can be the catalysts for new possibilities for action. 
The narrative therapist demonstrates faith that these inner resources and competen-
cies can be identified, even when the client is having difficulty seeing them.
During the narrative conversation, attention is given to avoiding totalizing lan-
guage, which reduces the complexity of the individual by assigning an all-embracing, 
single description to the essence of the person. Therapists begin to separate the per-
son from the problem in their mind as they listen and respond (Winslade & Monk, 
2007). This is called double listening.
The  narrative  perspective  focuses  on  the  capacity  of  humans  for  creative  and  
imaginative thought, which is often found in their resistance to dominant discourse. 
Narrative practitioners do not assume that they know more about the lives of clients 
than their clients do. Clients are the primary interpreters of their own experiences. 
People are viewed as active agents who are able to derive meaning from their expe-
riential world, and they are encouraged to join with others who might share in the 
development of a counter story.
The Therapeutic Process
This brief overview of the steps in the narrative therapeutic process illustrates the 
structure of the narrative approach (O’Hanlon, 1994, pp. 25–26):
Collaborate with the client to come up with a mutually acceptable 
name for the problem.
Personify the problem and attribute oppressive intentions and tactics 
to it.
Investigate how the problem has been disrupting, dominating, or dis-
couraging to the client.
Invite the client to see his or her story from a different perspective by 
inquiring into alternative meanings for events.
Discover moments when the client wasn’t dominated or discouraged by 
the problem by searching for exceptions to the problem.
Find historical evidence to bolster a new view of the client as competent 
enough to have stood up to, defeated, or escaped from the dominance

or oppression of the problem. (At this phase the person’s identity and 
life story begin to be rewritten.)
Ask the client to speculate about what kind of future could be expected 
from the strong, competent person who is emerging. As the client 
becomes free of problem-saturated stories of the past, he or she can 
envision and plan for a less problematic future.
Find or create an audience for perceiving and supporting the new story. 
It is not enough to recite a counter story. The client needs to live the 
counter story outside of therapy. Because the person’s problem initially 
developed in a social context, it is essential to involve the social environ-
ment in supporting the new life story that has emerged in the conversa-
tions with the therapist.
Winslade and Monk (2007) stress that narrative conversations do not follow the 
linear progression described here; it is better to think of these steps in terms of cycli-
cal progression containing the following elements:
Move problem stories toward externalized descriptions of problems
Map the effects of a problem on the individual
Invite the individual to evaluate the problem and its effects
Listen to signs of strength and competence in an individual’s problem-
saturated stories
Build a new story of competence and document these achievements
Therapy Goals A general goal of narrative therapy is to invite people to describe 
their  experience  in  new  and  fresh  language.  In  doing  this,  they  open  new  vistas  
of  what  is  possible.  This  new  language  enables  clients  to  develop  new  meanings  
for  problematic  thoughts,  feelings,  and  behaviors  (Freedman  &  Combs,  1996).  
Narrative  therapy  almost  always  includes  an  awareness  of  the  impact  of  various  
aspects of dominant culture on human life. Narrative practitioners seek to enlarge 
the  perspective  and  facilitate  the  discovery  or  creation  of  new  options  that  are  
unique to the people they see.
Therapist’s  Function  and  Role  Narrative  therapists  are  active  facilitators.  The  
concepts  of  care,  interest,  respectful  curiosity,  openness,  empathy,  contact,  and  
even fascination are seen as a relational necessity. The not-knowing position, which 
allows  therapists  to  follow,  affirm,  and  be  guided  by  the  stories  of  their  clients,  
creates  participant-observer  and  process-facilitator  roles  for  the  therapist  and  
integrates therapy with a postmodern view of human inquiry.
A  main  task  of  the  therapist  is  to  help  clients  construct  a  preferred  story  line.  
The  narrative  therapist  adopts  a  stance  characterized  by  respectful  curiosity  and  
works  with  clients  to  explore  both  the  impact  of  the  problem  on  them  and  what  
they are doing to reduce the effects of the problem (Winslade & Monk, 2007). One 
of the main functions of the therapist is to ask questions of clients and, based on the 
answers, to generate further questions.
White  and  Epston  (1990)  start  with  an  exploration  of  the  client  in  relation  to  
the presenting problem. It is not uncommon for clients to present initial stories in 
which they and the problem are fused, as if one and the same. White uses questions

aimed at separating the problem from the people affected by the problem. This shift 
in language begins the deconstruction of the original narrative in which the person 
and the problem were fused; now the problem is objectified as external to the client.
Like  the  solution-focused  therapist,  the  narrative  therapist  assumes  the  client  
is the expert when it comes to what he or she wants in life. The narrative therapist 
tends to avoid using language that embodies diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and 
intervention.  Functions  such  as  diagnosis  and  assessment  often  grant  priority  to  
the  practitioner’s  “truth”  over  clients’  knowledge  about  their  own  lives.  The  nar-
rative approach gives emphasis to understanding clients’ lived experiences and de-
emphasizes efforts to predict, interpret, and pathologize.
Monk  (1997)  emphasizes  that  narrative  therapy  will  vary  with  each  client  
because  each  person  is  unique.  For  Monk,  narrative  conversations  are  based  on  a  
way  of  being,  and  if  narrative  counseling  “is  seen  as  a  formula  or  used  as  a  recipe,  
clients will have the experience of having things done to them and feel left out of the 
conversation” (p. 24).
The  Therapeutic  Relationship  Narrative  therapists  place  great  importance  
on the values and ethical commitments a therapist brings to the therapy venture. Some 
of  these  attitudes  include  optimism  and  respect,  curiosity  and  persistence,  valuing  
the  client’s  knowledge,  and  creating  a  special  kind  of  relationship  characterized  by  a  
real  power-sharing  dialogue  (Winslade  &  Monk,  2007).  Collaboration,  compassion,  
reflection, and discovery characterize the therapeutic relationship. The strengths-based 
and  future-focused  nature  of  narrative  therapy  lends  itself  to  a  more  collaborative  
relationship  than  problem-based  approaches  that  emphasize  the  therapist  as  the  
expert in the relationship (Rice, 2015). If this relationship is to be truly collaborative, 
the therapist needs to be aware of how power manifests itself in his or her professional 
practice. This does not mean that the therapist does not have authority as a professional. 
He or she uses this authority, however, by treating clients as experts in their own lives.
Winslade,  Crocket,  and  Monk  (1997)  describe  this  collaboration  as  coauthor-
ing or sharing authority. Clients function as authors when they have the authority 
to  speak  on  their  own  behalf.  In  the  narrative  approach,  the  therapist-as-expert  is  
replaced by the client-as-expert. This notion challenges the stance of the therapist as 
being an all-wise and all-knowing expert.
Clients are often stuck in a pattern of living a problem-saturated story that does 
not work. When a client has a limited perception of his or her capacities due to being 
saturated in problem thinking, it is the job of the therapist to elicit other strength-
related  stories  to  modify  the  client’s  perception.  The  therapist  assists  the  client  in  
this  pursuit  by  entering  into  a  dialogue  and  asking  questions  in  an  effort  to  elicit  
the perspectives, resources, and unique experiences of the client. The past is history, 
but  it  sometimes  provides  a  foundation  for  understanding  and  discovering  news  
of  differences  or  unique  outcomes  that  will  make  a  difference.  The  history  of  the  
problem often dominates understanding, but there is another history that narrative 
therapists argue should not be neglected. It is the history of the counter story to the 
problem  story,  which  is  constructed  in  conversation  and  becomes  the  foundation  
for a different future. The narrative therapist supplies the optimism and sometimes 
a process, but the client generates what is possible and contributes the movement 
that actualizes it.

Application: Therapeutic Techniques and Procedures
The  effective  application  of  narrative  therapy  is  more  dependent  on  thera-
pists’ attitudes or perspectives than on techniques. In the practice of narrative ther-
apy, there is no recipe, no set agenda, and no formula that the therapist can follow 
to  assure  positive  results  (Drewery  &  Winslade,  1997).  When  externalizing  ques-
tions are approached mainly as a technique, the intervention will be shallow, forced, 
and  unlikely  to  produce  significant  therapeutic  effects  (Freedman  &  Combs,  1996;  
O’Hanlon, 1994).
Narrative therapists are in agreement with Carl Rogers on the importance of the 
therapist’s way of being rather than being technique driven. A narrative approach to 
counseling is more than the application of skills; it is based on the therapist’s per-
sonal characteristics that create a climate that encourages clients to see their stories 
from different perspectives. Narrative therapists emphasize their willingness to see 
beyond dominant cultural norms and to appreciate clients’ differences. However, a 
series of “maps” of narrative conversational trajectories can help give structure and 
direction to a therapeutic conversation (White, 2007).
Questions . . . and More Questions The questions narrative therapists ask may 
seem embedded in a unique conversation, part of a dialogue about earlier dialogues, 
a discovery of unique events, or an exploration of dominant culture processes and 
imperatives. Whatever the purpose, the questions are often circular, or relational, and 
they seek to empower clients in new ways. To use Gregory Bateson’s (1972) famous 
phrase, they are questions in search of a difference that will make a difference.
Narrative therapists use questions as a way to generate experience rather than to 
gather information. The aim of questioning is to progressively discover or construct 
the client’s experience so that the client has a sense of a preferred direction. Ques-
tions are always asked from a position of respect, curiosity, and openness. Therapists 
ask  questions  from  a  not-knowing  position,  meaning  that  they  do  not  pose  ques-
tions that they think they already know the answers to.
Through  the  process  of  asking  questions,  therapists  provide  clients  with  an  
opportunity  to  explore  various  dimensions  of  their  life  situations.  This  question-
ing  process  helps  bring  out  the  unstated  cultural  assumptions  that  contribute  to  
the original construction of the problem. The therapist is interested in finding out 
how the problems first became evident, and how they have affected clients’ views of 
themselves (Monk, 1997). Narrative therapists attempt to engage people in decon-
structing  problem-saturated  stories,  identifying  preferred  directions,  and  creating  
alternative stories that support these preferred directions. For a more complete dis-
cussion of the use of questions in narrative therapy, see Madigan (2011).
Externalization  and  Deconstruction  Narrative  therapists  believe  it  is  not  the  
person  that  is  the  problem,  but  the  problem  that  is  the  problem  (White,  1989).  
These problems often are products of the cultural world or of the power relations in 
which this world is located. Living life means relating to problems, not being fused 
with them. Narrative therapists help clients deconstruct these problematic stories 
by disassembling the taken-for-granted assumptions that are made about an event, 
which then opens alternative possibilities for living.

Externalization is one process for deconstructing the power of a narrative. This 
process  separates  the  person  from  identification  with  the  problem.  When  clients  
view themselves as “being” the problem, they are limited in the ways they can effec-
tively deal with the problem. When clients experience the problem as being located 
outside  of  themselves,  they  create  a  relationship  with  the  problem.  For  example,  
there  is  quite  a  difference  between  labeling  someone  an  alcoholic  and  indicating  
that alcohol has invaded his or her life. Separating the problem from the individual 
facilitates hope and enables clients to take a stand against specific story lines, such 
as self-blame. By understanding the cultural invitations to blame oneself, clients can 
deconstruct this story line and generate a more positive, healing story.
The method used to separate the person from the problem is referred to as exter-
nalizing conversation, which opens up space for new stories to emerge. This method 
is particularly useful when people have internalized diagnoses and labels that have 
not  been  validating  or  empowering  of  the  change  process  (Bertolino  &  O’Hanlon,  
2002). 
externalizing conversations counteract oppressive, problem-saturated sto-
ries and empower clients to feel competent to handle the problems they face. Two 
stages of structuring externalizing conversations are (1) to map the influence of the 
problem in the person’s life, and (2) to map the influence of the person’s life back on 
the problem (McKenzie & Monk, 1997).
Mapping the influence of the problem on the person generates a great deal of 
useful  information  and  often  results  in  people  feeling  less  shamed  and  blamed.  
People feel listened to and understood when the problem’s influences are explored 
in  a  systematic  fashion.  A  common  question  is,  “When  did  this  problem  first  
appear in your life?” When this mapping is done carefully, it lays the foundation 
for  coauthoring  a  new  story  line  for  the  client.  Often  clients  feel  outraged  when  
they  see  for  the  first  time  how  much  the  problem  is  affecting  them.  The  job  of  
the therapist is to assist clients in tracing the problem from when it originated to 
the present. Therapists may put a future twist on the problem by asking, “If the 
problem were to continue for a month (or any time period), what would this mean 
for you?” This question can motivate the client to join with the therapist in com-
bating  the  impact  of  the  problem’s  effects.  Other  useful  questions  are  “To  what  
extent has this problem influenced your life?” and “How deeply has this problem 
affected you?”
It is important to identify instances when the problem did not completely dom-
inate  a  client’s  life.  This  kind  of  mapping  can  help  the  client  who  is  disillusioned  
by the problem see some hope for a different kind of life. Therapists look for these 
“sparkling  moments”  as  they  engage  in  externalizing  conversations  with  clients  
(White & Epston, 1990).
The  case  of  Brandon  illustrates  an  externalizing  conversation.  Brandon  says  
that he gets angry far too much, especially when he feels that his wife is criticizing 
him unjustly: “I just flare! I pop off, get upset, fight back. Later, I wish I hadn’t, but 
it’s too late. I’ve messed up again.” Questions about how his anger occurs, complete 
with specific examples and events, can help chart the influence of the problem. How-
ever, it is questions like the ones that follow that externalize the problem: “What is 
the mission of the anger, and how does it recruit you into this mission?” “How does 
the  anger  get  you,  and  how  does  it  trick  you  into  letting  it  become  so  powerful?”  
“What does the anger require of you, and what happens to you when you meet its

requirements?”  “What  cultural  supports  (in  your  family/community/world)  have  
shaped the role that anger plays for you?”
Search for Unique Outcomes In the narrative approach, externalizing questions 
are  followed  by  questions  searching  for  unique  outcomes.  The  therapist  talks  to  
the client about moments of choice or success regarding the problem. This is done 
by selecting for attention any experience that stands apart from the problem story, 
regardless of how insignificant it might seem to the client. The therapist may ask: 
“Was  there  ever  a  time  in  which  anger  wanted  to  take  you  over,  and  you  resisted?  
What  was  that  like  for  you?  How  did  you  do  it?”  These  questions  are  aimed  at  
highlighting  moments  when  the  problem  has  not  occurred  or  when  the  problem  
has been dealt with successfully. Unique outcomes can often be found in the past 
or the present, but they can also be hypothesized for the future: “What form would 
standing  up  against  your  anger  take?”  Exploring  questions  such  as  these  enables  
clients  to  see  that  change  is  possible.  Linking  a  series  of  such  unique  outcomes  
together starts to form a counter story. It is within the account of unique outcomes 
that a gateway is provided for alternative versions of a person’s life (White, 1992).
Following the description of a unique outcome, White (1992) suggests posing 
questions, both direct and indirect, that lead to the elaboration of preferred identity 
stories:
What do you think this tells me about what you have wanted for your 
life and about what you have been trying for in your life?
How do you think knowing this has affected my view of you as a person?
Of all those people who have known you, who would be least surprised 
that you have been able to take this step in addressing your problem’s 
influence in your life?
What actions might you commit yourself to if you were to more fully 
embrace this knowledge of who you are? (p. 133)
The development of unique outcome stories into solution stories is facilitated 
by what Epston and White (1992) call “circulation questions”:
Now that you have reached this point in life, who else should know 
about it?
I guess there are a number of people who have an outdated view of 
who you are as a person. What ideas do you have about updating these 
views?
If other people seek therapy for the same reasons you did, can I share 
with them any of the important discoveries you have made? (p. 23)
These questions are not asked in a barrage-like manner. Questioning is an integral 
part  of  the  context  of  the  narrative  conversation,  and  each  question  is  sensitively  
attuned to the responses brought out by the previous question (White, 1992).
McKenzie  and  Monk  (1997)  suggest  that  therapists  seek  permission  from  the  
client before asking a series of questions. By letting a client know that they do not 
have answers to the questions they raise, therapists are putting the client in control 
of  the  therapeutic  process.  Asking  permission  of  the  client  to  use  persistent  ques-
tioning tends to minimize the risk of inadvertently pressuring the client.

Alternative  Stories  and  Reauthoring  Constructing  counter  stories  goes  hand  
in  hand  with  deconstruction,  and  the  narrative  therapist  listens  for  openings  to  
counter stories. People can continually and actively reauthor their lives, and narrative 
therapists  invite  clients  to  author  alternative  stories  through  “unique  outcomes”;  
these  events  could  not  be  predicted  from  listening  to  the  dominant  problem-
saturated story and are not included in any narrative about the person. The narrative 
therapist  asks  for  openings:  “Have  you  ever  been  able  to  escape  the  influence  of  the  
problem?” The therapist listens for clues to competence in the midst of a problematic 
story  and  builds  a  story  of  competence  around  it.  Madigan  (2011)  suggests  that  a  
person’s  life  story  is  probably  much  more  interesting  than  the  story  being  told.  He  
maintains a therapist’s main task is “to help people to remember, reclaim and reinvent 
a richer, thicker, and more meaningful alternative story” (p. 159).
A turning point in the narrative interview comes when clients make the choice 
of whether to continue to live by a problem-saturated story or to state a preference 
for an alternative story (Winslade & Monk, 2007). Through the use of unique pos-
sibility questions, the therapist moves the focus into the future. For example: “Given 
what you have learned about yourself, what is the next step you might take?” “When 
you are acting from your preferred identity, what actions will it lead you to do more 
of?”  Such  questions  encourage  people  to  reflect  upon  what  they  have  presently  
achieved and what their next steps might be.
White and Epston’s (1990) inquiry into unique outcomes is similar to the excep-
tion questions of solution-focused therapists. Both seek to build on the competence 
already present in the person. The development of alternative stories, or narratives, 
is  an  enactment  of  ultimate  hope:  Today  is  the  first  day  of  the  rest  of  your  life.  
Refer to Case Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 2013, chap. 11) for two 
concrete examples of a narrative approach to working with Ruth from the perspec-
tives of Dr. Gerald Monk and Dr. John Winslade.
Documenting the Evidence Narrative practitioners believe that new stories take 
hold  only  when  there  is  an  audience  to  appreciate  and  support  them.  Gaining  an  
audience for the news that change is taking place needs to occur if alternative stories 
are to stay alive, and an appreciative audience to new developments is consciously 
sought.
One  technique  for  consolidating  the  gains  a  client  makes  involves  a  therapist  
writing letters to the person. Narrative therapists have pioneered the development of 
therapeutic letter writing. These letters that the therapist writes provide a record of 
the session and may include an externalizing description of the problem and its influ-
ence on the client, as well as an account of the client’s strengths and abilities that are 
identified in a session. Letters can be read again at different times, and the story that 
they are part of can be reinspired. The letter highlights the struggle the client has had 
with  the  problem  and  draws  distinctions  between  the  problem-saturated  story  and  
the developing new and preferred story (McKenzie & Monk, 1997).
Epston  has  developed  a  special  facility  for  carrying  on  therapeutic  dialogues  
between sessions through the use of letters (White & Epston, 1990). His letters may 
be  long,  chronicling  the  process  of  the  interview  and  the  agreements  reached,  or  
short,  highlighting  a  meaning  or  understanding  reached  in  the  session  and  ask-

Usually they include as many direct quotations from what the client said as possible. 
These letters are used to encourage clients, noting what they said about their own 
accomplishments in relation to handling problems or speculating on the meaning 
of their accomplishments for others in their community. Letters documenting the 
changes  clients  have  achieved  tend  to  strengthen  the  significance  of  the  changes,  
both for the client and for others in the client’s life.
Narrative letters reinforce the importance of carrying what is being learned in the 
therapy office into everyday life. The message conveyed is that participating fully in 
the world is more important than being in the therapy office. In an informal survey 
of the perceptions of the value of narrative letters by past clients, the average worth of 
a letter was equal to more than three individual sessions (Nylund & Thomas, 1994). 
This finding is consistent with McKenzie and Monk’s (1997) statement: “Some nar-
rative counselors have suggested that a well-composed letter following a therapy ses-
sion or preceding another can be equal to about five regular sessions” (p. 113).
Application  to  Group  Counseling  Many  of  the  techniques  described  
in  this  chapter  can  be  applied  to  group  counseling.  Winslade  and  Monk  (2007)  
claim  that  the  narrative  emphasis  on  creating  an  appreciative  audience  for  new  
developments  in  an  individual’s  life  lends  itself  to  group  counseling.  They  state:  
“Groups  provide  a  ready-made  community  of  concern  and  many  opportunities  
for  the  kind  of  interaction  that  opens  possibilities  for  new  ways  of  living.  New  
identities  can  be  rehearsed  and  tried  out  into  a  wider  world”  (p.  135).  They  give  
several examples of working in a narrative way with groups in schools: getting back 
on track in schoolwork; an adventure-based program; an anger management group; 
and a grief counseling group. For a detailed description of these narrative groups, 
see Winslade and Monk (2007, chap. 5).
Postmodern Approaches From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
Social  constructionism  is  congruent  with  the  philosophy  of  multicultur-
alism.  One  of  the  problems  that  culturally  diverse  clients  often  experience  is  the  
expectation  that  they  should  conform  their  lives  to  the  truths  and  reality  of  the  
dominant society of which they are a part. With the emphasis on multiple realities 
and the assumption that what is perceived to be a truth is the product of social con-
struction, the postmodern approaches are a good fit with diverse worldviews.
The  social  constructionist  approach  to  therapy  provides  clients  with  a  frame-
work  to  think  about  their  thinking  and  to  determine  the  impact  stories  have  on  
what  they  do.  Clients  are  encouraged  to  explore  how  their  realities  are  being  con-
structed out of cultural discourse and the consequences that follow from such con-
structions.  Within  the  framework  of  their  cultural  values  and  worldview,  clients  
can  explore  their  beliefs  and  provide  their  own  reinterpretations  of  significant  life  
events. The practitioner with a social constructionist perspective can guide clients in 
a manner that respects their underlying values. This dimension is especially impor-
tant in those cases where counselors are from a different cultural background or do 
not share the same worldview as their clients.

Narrative  therapy  is  grounded  in  a  sociocultural  context,  which  makes  this  
approach especially relevant for counseling culturally diverse clients. Narrative ther-
apists  operate  on  the  premise  that  problems  are  identified  within  social,  cultural,  
political,  and  relational  contexts  rather  than  existing  within  individuals.  They  are  
very much concerned with considering the specifications of gender, ethnicity, race, 
disability, sexual orientation, social class, and spirituality and religion as therapeutic 
issues.  Furthermore,  therapy  becomes  a  place  to  reauthor  the  social  constructions  
and identity narratives that clients are finding problematic.
Narrative therapy is a relational and anti-individualistic practice. Michael White 
believes that to address a person’s struggles in therapy without a relational and con-
textual  understanding  of  his  or  her  story  is  entirely  absurd  (as  cited  in  Madigan,  
2011). Narrative therapists concentrate on problem stories that dominate and sub-
jugate at the personal, social, and cultural levels. The sociopolitical conceptualiza-
tion of problems sheds light on those cultural notions and practices that produce 
dominant and oppressive narratives. From this orientation, practitioners take apart 
the cultural assumptions that are a part of a client’s problem situation. People are 
able to come to an understanding of how oppressive social practices have affected 
them. This awareness can lead to a new perspective on dominant themes of oppres-
sion that have been such an integral part of a client’s story, and with this cultural 
awareness new stories can be generated.
In  their  discussion  of  the  multicultural  influences  on  clients,  Bertolino  and  
O’Hanlon (2002) approach clients without a preconceived notion about their expe-
rience  and  learn  from  their  clients  about  their  experiential  world.  Bertolino  and  
O’Hanlon practice multicultural curiosity by listening respectfully to their clients, 
who become their best teachers. Here are some questions these authors suggest as a 
way to more fully understand multicultural influences on a client:
Tell me more about the influence that [some aspect of your culture] has 
played in your life.
What can you share with me about your background that will enable 
me to more fully understand you?
What challenges have you faced growing up in your culture?
What, if anything, about your background has been difficult for you?
How have you been able to draw on strengths and resources from your 
culture? What resources can you draw from in times of need?
Questions such as these can shed light on specific cultural influences that have 
been sources of support or that contributed to a client’s problem.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
A  potential  shortcoming  of  the  postmodern  approaches  pertains  to  the  not-
knowing  stance  the  therapist  assumes,  along  with  the  assumption  of  the  client-
as-expert.  Individuals  from  many  different  cultural  groups  tend  to  elevate  the  
professional  as  the  expert  who  will  offer  direction  and  solutions  for  the  person  
seeking help. If the therapist is telling the client, “I am not really an expert; you 
are  the  expert;  I  trust  in  your  resources  for  you  to  find  solutions  to  your  prob-
lems,” then this may engender lack of confidence in the therapist. To avoid this

situation, the therapist using a solution-focused or a narrative orientation needs 
to  convey  to  clients  that  he  or  she  has  expertise  in  the  process  of  therapy  but  
clients are the experts in knowing what they want in their lives. The postmodern 
approaches  stress  being  transparent  with  clients  and  honoring  their  hopes  and  
expectations in therapy. This emphasis creates a context for providing culturally 
responsive services.
I 
operate from an integrative perspective by combining 
concepts  and  techniques  from  the  solution-focused  
and  narrative  approaches.  From  this  framework,  I  am  
philosophically  opposed  to  assessment  and  diagnosis  
using  the  DSM-5  model,  and  I  do  not  begin  therapy  
with a formal assessment. Instead, I engage Stan in col-
laborative  conversations  centered  on  change,  compe-
tence,  preferences,  possibilities,  and  ideas  for  making  
changes in the future.
I begin my work with Stan by inviting him to tell 
me  about  the  concerns  that  brought  him  to  therapy  
and  what  he  expects  to  accomplish  in  his  sessions.  I  
also  provide  Stan  with  a  brief  orientation  of  some  of  
the  basic  ideas  that  guide  my  practice  and  describe  
my  view  of  counseling  as  a  collaborative  partnership  
in  which  he  is  the  senior  partner.  Stan  is  somewhat  
surprised  by  this  because  he  expected  that  I  was  the  
person with the experience and expertise. He informs 
me that he has very little confidence in knowing how 
to proceed with his life, especially since he has “messed 
up” so often. I am aware that he has self-doubts when 
it comes to assuming the role of senior partner. How-
ever,  I  work  to  demystify  the  therapeutic  process  and  
establish  a  collaborative  relationship,  conveying  to  
Stan  that  he  is  in  charge  of  the  direction  his  therapy  
will  take.  I  also  promise  to  explore  the  undermining  
effects  of  the  self-doubts  in  his  life  and  how  he  has  
managed to live life in spite of these.
Soon after this orientation to how therapy works, 
I  inquire  about  some  specific  goals  that  Stan  would  
like to reach through the therapy sessions. Stan gives 
clear  signs  that  he  is  willing  and  eager  to  change.  
However,  he  adds  that  he  has  become  convinced  that  
he  suffers  from  low  self-esteem.  As  he  tells  me  more  
about how self-doubts cripple him regularly and lead 
to  a  negative  evaluation  of  himself  as  “messed  up,”  I  
begin to externalize the idea of self-doubts and inquire 
into  the  history  of  their  appearance  in  his  life.  I  also  
carefully map the effects of self-doubts in his life. Then 
I start to focus Stan on looking for exceptions to the 
self-doubts.  I  pose  an  exception  question  (solution-
focused therapy): “What is different about the contexts 
or times when you have not experienced self-doubts?” 
Stan  is  able  to  identify  some  positive  characteristics:  
his  courage,  determination,  and  willingness  to  try  
new things in spite of his self-doubts, and his gift for 
working with children. Stan knows what he wants out 
of  therapy  and  has  clear  goals:  to  achieve  his  educa-
tional goals, to enhance his belief in himself, to relate 
to women without fear, and to feel more joy instead of 
sadness  and  anxiety.  I  invite  Stan  to  talk  more  about  
how he has managed to make the gains he has in spite 
of struggling with the problem of self-doubt.
I allow Stan to share his problem-saturated story, 
but  I  do  not  get  stuck  in  this  narrative.  I  invite  Stan  
to think of his problems as external to the core of his 
selfhood. I help him to notice the cultural forces that 
have recruited him into a story of thinking less about 
himself.  Even  during  the  early  sessions,  I  encourage  
Stan  to  separate  his  being  from  his  problems  by  pos-
ing questions that externalize his problem.
Although   Stan   presents   several   problem   areas   
that are of concern to him, I work with him on identi-
fying one particular problem. Stan says he is depressed 
a great deal of the time, and he worries that his depres-
sion might someday overwhelm him. After listening to 
Stan’s fears and concerns, I ask Stan the miracle ques-
tion (solution-focused technique): “Let’s suppose that 
a miracle were to happen while you are asleep tonight. 
When  you  wake  up  tomorrow,  the  problems  you  are  
mentioning are gone. What would be the signs to you 
that this miracle actually occurred and that your prob-
lems  were  solved?  How  would  your  life  be  different?”  
With  this  intervention,  I  am  shifting  the  focus  from

talking  about  problems  to  talking  about  solutions.  
I  explain  to  Stan  that  much  of  his  therapy  will  deal  
with finding both present and future solutions rather 
than  dwelling  on  past  problems.  Together  we  engage  
in a conversation that features change-talk rather than 
problem-talk.
To  a  great  extent,  Stan  has  linked  his  identity  
story  with  his  problems,  especially  depression.  He  
doesn’t  think  of  his  problems  as  being  separate  from  
himself.  I  want  Stan  to  realize  that  he  personally  is  
not  his  problem,  but  instead  that  the  problem  is  the  
problem. When I ask Stan to give a name to his prob-
lem,  he  eventually  comes  up  with  “Disabling  depres-
sion!”  He  then  relates  how  his  depression  has  kept  
him from functioning the way he would like in many 
areas  of  his  life.  I  then  use  externalizing  questions  (nar-
rative  technique)  as  a  way  to  separate  Stan  from  his  
problem: “How long has depression gotten the best of 
you?” “What has depression cost you?” “What conclu-
sions about yourself does it talk you into?” “What do 
you  think  of  what  it  has  been  doing  to  mess  up  your  
life?”  “Have  there  been  times  when  you  stood  up  to  
depression and did not let it win?” Of course, I briefly 
explain to him what I am doing by using externalizing 
language, lest he think this is a strange way to counsel. 
I talk more about the advantages of engaging in exter-
nalizing conversations. I also talk with Stan about the 
importance  of  mapping  the  effects  of  the  problem  
on  his  life.  This  process  involves  exploring  how  long  
the problem has been around, the extent to which the 
problem has influenced various aspects of his life, and 
how deeply the problem continues to affect him.
As  the  sessions  progress,  there  is  a  collaborative  
effort aimed at investigating how the problem has been 
a  disrupting,  dominating,  and  discouraging  influence.  
Stan  comes  to  view  his  story  from  a  different  perspec-
tive. I continue talking with Stan about those moments 
when  he  has  not  been  dominated  or  discouraged  by  
depression  and  anxiety  and  continue  to  search  for  
exceptions  to  these  problematic  experiences.  Stan  and  
I  participate  in  conversations  about  unique  outcomes,  
or  occasions  when  he  has  demonstrated  courage  and  
persistence in the face of discouraging events. Some of 
these “sparkling moments” include Stan’s accomplish-
ments in college, volunteer work with children, progress 
in curbing his tendencies to abuse alcohol, willingness 
to  challenge  his  fears  and  make  new  acquaintances,  
talking back to self-defeating internal messages, accom-
plishments  in  securing  employment,  and  his  willing-
ness to create a vision of a productive future.
With  my  help,  Stan  accumulates  evidence  from  
his past to bolster a new view of himself as competent 
enough to have escaped from the dominance of prob-
lematic stories. At this phase in his therapy, Stan makes 
a decision to create an alternative narrative. Several ses-
sions  are  devoted  to  reauthoring  Stan’s  story  in  ways  
that  are  lively,  creative,  and  colorful.  Along  with  the  
process  of  creating  an  alternative  story,  I  explore  with  
Stan the possibilities of recruiting an audience who will 
reinforce his positive changes. I ask, “Who do you know 
who  would  be  least  surprised  to  hear  of  your  recent  
changes, and what would this person know about you 
that would lead to him or her not being so surprised?” 
Stan identifies one of his early teachers who served as a 
mentor to him and who believed in him when Stan had 
little belief in himself. Some therapy time is devoted to 
discussing how new stories take root only when there is 
an audience to appreciate them.
After  five  therapy  sessions,  Stan  brings  up  the  
matter  of  termination.  At  the  sixth  and  final  session,  
I  introduce  scaling  questions,  asking  Stan  to  rate  his  
degree  of  improvement  on  a  range  of  problems  we  
explored  in  the  past  weeks.  On  a  scale  of  zero  to  10,  
Stan  ranks  how  he  saw  himself  prior  to  his  first  ses-
sion and how he sees himself today on various specific 
dimensions (scaling technique). We also talked about 
Stan’s goals for his future and what kinds of improve-
ments  he  will  need  to  make  to  attain  what  he  wants.  
I  then  give  Stan  a  letter  I  wrote  summarizing  both  
the problem story and its effects and also the counter 
story  that  we  have  been  developing  in  therapy.  In  my  
narrative  letter,  I  describe  Stan’s  determination  and  
cooperation  in  his  own  words  and  encourage  him  to  
circulate  the  news  of  the  differences  he  has  brought  
about in his life. I also ask some questions that invite 
him to develop the new story of identity more fully.
Questions for Reflection
As Stan’s therapist, I borrowed key concepts and 
techniques common to both solution-focused and 
narrative orientations. In your work with Stan, 
what specific concepts would you borrow from 
each of these approaches? What techniques would 
you draw from each of the approaches? What

possible advantages do you see, if any, in applying 
an integration of solution-focused and narrative 
models in your work with Stan?
What unique values, if any, do you see in work-
ing with Stan from a postmodern perspective as 
opposed to working with Stan from the other 
therapeutic approaches you’ve studied thus far?
I asked many questions of Stan. List some addi-
tional questions you would be particularly inter-
ested in pursuing with Stan.
In what ways could you integrate SFBT and narra-
tive therapy with feminist therapy in Stan’s case? 
What other therapies might you combine with the 
postmodern approaches? What other therapies 
would not combine so well with these postmodern 
therapies?
At this point, you are very familiar with the 
themes in Stan’s life. If you were to write a narra-
tive letter that you would then give to Stan, what 
would you most want to include? What would you 
want to talk to him about regarding his future?

overwhelmed  she  is  with  the  number  of  assign-
ments she has at work.
Gwen: I don’t think I can handle the pressure of these 
new assignments.
Therapist: On a scale of zero to 10, where zero is no 
pressure and 10 is extreme pressure. Where would 
your feeling of pressure be on the scale?
Gwen: 8! I should have just kept quiet and not taken on 
any new projects. I always do this to myself. I wish I 
could start over and not take on so much. I am miss-
ing out on time with my family and friends because 
I have piled the work on so high! I don’t know why 
I create so much work for myself. I know people at 
work can see that I am on the edge. I am not feeling 
good about anything I am doing these days. I know 
I’m ruining my reputation because I just can’t get 
things done. I am missing in action in my own life.
Therapist: Tell me about some times when you did 
not feel this way. What were you doing when 
things were getting done that you are not doing 
now?
I  encourage  Gwen  to  think  about  some  time  when  
her stress was not so overwhelming and what she did 
to better manage her stress. This focus on discovering 
Gwen’s strengths puts Gwen in the position of being 
the expert on her own life. I am confident that Gwen 
has the a capacity to find solutions to her challenges.
Gwen is so accustomed to her story of anxiety and 
feeling overwhelmed that it is difficult for her to shift 
gears and observe that she is doing several things well 
in her life. My interventions are aimed at assisting her 
in seeing herself as more than being highly anxious.
Therapist: In the midst of your busy life, you have 
remained committed to therapy. I find that very 
impressive given your schedule and the number of 
obligations you are juggling. I wonder what else 
might be going well in your life.
Gwen: I have been arriving at work on time, and that 
feels pretty good. Also, I took time for a swimming 
lesson even though I was stressed out about getting 
my projects done. I must say that I felt so much 
better afterward.

Therapist: If you had a magic wand and could solve 
your problem today, how would you know it was 
solved? [The miracle question]
Gwen: I would know it was solved if I did not have 
a stomach ache, did not triple book meetings, 
didn’t have five projects due all at once, felt com-
fortable taking time for relaxation, had time to go 
out with friends, and didn’t have stacks of paper 
around my house and office just waiting for me to 
handle it all.
Therapist: What would you be doing or feeling that 
would be different?
Gwen:
 I would be able to go home at a reasonable 
time at after work. I would feel more rested. I 
would have healthy and balanced meals, and I 
would have more quality time with my husband 
and children. At work, I would feel good about the 
projects I was finishing, and I would resist taking 
on too many projects at the same time.
The miracle question, or the magic wand question 
as I call it, is a way to assist Gwen in projecting into the 
future to the life she wants to experience. I emphasize 
that doing one thing differently could be a significant 
step in finding a solution.
Therapist: I invite you to rip up your canvas of anxiety 
and create a new portrait of calm in your life by 
doing one thing differently. What do you think you 
can change this week?
Gwen: I will begin my day with prayer and some 
stretching exercises to help me loosen up and to re-
duce my stress level. And I think it is time to resign 
from one of the committees I am on now.
Therapist: Those are great choices you are making. I 
look forward to hearing how you did when we meet 
next week.
I  compliment  Gwen  on  the  progress  she  is  making,  
and in our next session I will follow up on her home-
work. I hope Gwen will discover that the answers she is 
seeking reside within herself.
Questions for Reflection
What interventions helped Gwen begin to think 
more about her resources and strengths than 
about her problems?
What do you think of the application of the mir-
acle question with Gwen? What steps did Gwen 
decide to take as a result of her answer?
If you were counseling Gwen and she was unable 
to recall any time when the problem did not exist, 
how would you move forward with her?

Words have the power to heal and transform our lives. 
Words also have the power to keep us spiraling down-
ward, accepting a negative story line that perpetuates 
feelings   of   depression,   scarcity,   fear,   anxiety,   self-
loathing, and more. Our stories fuel our thoughts and 
behaviors,  and  we  must  make  sure  that  these  stories  
are  not  a  source  of  negative  programming  that  keeps  
us stuck. If Gwen is willing to keep a journal and write 
about her younger self, I think she will begin to recon-
struct the story of her true self today.
Therapist: Words can become our medicine and our 
tool for transformation and healing. I would like 
you to use this journal to write about your story 
of loneliness. Try to identify when loneliness first 
appeared in your life. Let the words present them-
selves in whatever way they come.
Gwen: I think I could write volumes about feeling 
unimportant, invisible, and insignificant when I 
was a child.
Therapist: Before you begin writing, sit quietly for 5 
minutes and connect to your younger self who first 
experienced these feelings of loneliness. Give that 
part of yourself a name and become a loving com-
panion to that lonely little girl inside of you.
My goal is to help Gwen externalize the problem she is 
experiencing and move it outside of herself. As Gwen 
separates  herself  from  her  problem-saturated  story,  
she can release the old patterns associated with the old 
story and literally rewrite her life to include peace, joy, 
and connection.
Gwen  writes  about  staying  in  the  house  to  avoid  
being called names by the kids on her street; being the 
odd  child  in  the  family  and  wanting  to  hide  because  
she  was  different;  waiting  days  for  her  dad  to  return  
home;  hiding  her  precious  items  in  a  special  box  so  
they  wouldn’t  get  stolen  when  the  house  was  broken  
into; being the only Black child in the Catholic Church

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
In  social  constructionist  theory  the  therapist-as-expert  is  replaced  by  the  
client-as-expert. Although clients are viewed as experts on their own lives, they are 
often stuck in patterns that are not working well for them. Both solution-focused 
and narrative therapists enter into dialogues in an effort to elicit the perspectives, 
resources,  and  unique  experiences  of  their  clients.  The  therapeutic  endeavor  is  a  
highly collaborative relationship in which the client is the senior partner. The quali-
ties of the therapeutic relationship are at the heart of the effectiveness of both SFBT 
and narrative therapy. This has resulted in many therapists giving increased atten-
tion  to  creating  a  collaborative  relationship  with  clients.  Collaborative  therapists  
adjust their approach to each client or group instead of requiring clients to adapt to 
their approach. Thus therapy may look very different for one client than for another.
The  not-knowing  position  of  the  therapist  has  been  infused  as  a  key  con-
cept of both the solution-focused and narrative therapeutic approaches. The not-
knowing  position,  which  allows  therapists  to  be  curious  about,  affirm,  and  be  
guided  by  the  stories  of  their  clients,  creates  participant-observer  and  process-
facilitator roles for the therapist and integrates therapy with a postmodern per-
spective of human inquiry.
Both solution-focused brief therapy and narrative therapy are based on the opti-
mistic assumption that people are healthy, competent, resourceful, and possess the 
ability to construct solutions and alternative stories that can enhance their lives. In 
SFBT the therapeutic process provides a context whereby individuals focus on creat-
ing solutions rather than talking about their problems. Some common techniques 
include  the  use  of  miracle  questions,  exception  questions,  and  scaling  questions.  
In  narrative  therapy  the  therapeutic  process  attends  to  the  sociocultural  context  
and feeling like she was under a microscope; and how 
she began to stay busy to keep herself safe. I work with 
Gwen  to  help  her  view  her  stories  through  a  lens  of  
compassion, growth, and healing.
As Gwen began to reconstruct her story, she was able 
to see that her parents did the best they could. She looked 
at the entire cast of her narrative with deeper compassion 
and saw that through the challenges of her childhood she 
become a strong, creative, resilient woman. From a posi-
tion  of  adult  strength,  Gwen  began  to  sooth  the  lonely  
little girl that still resides in her heart. Through writing, 
Gwen  could  see  that  she  was  wounded  but  not  broken.  
Narrative therapy helped Gwen come closer to a place of 
self-love and forgiveness, and her anxiety began to lessen 
as she released the repressed emotions that had kept her 
isolated and lonely. In her final session, Gwen and I devel-
oped a written “graduation speech” together in which we 
formalized the fact that she is no longer a child and has 
moved beyond her history.
Questions for Reflection
What therapeutic purpose is served when the 
therapist helps Gwen separate herself from the 
problem?
What value do you see in journal writing as a tool 
to assist Gwen in reconstructing her story?
What is one other technique from narrative ther-
apy that you would want to use with Gwen?
How do you experience hearing about Gwen’s sto-
ries of loneliness?

wherein  clients  are  assisted  in  separating  themselves  from  their  problems  and  are  
afforded the opportunity of authoring new stories.
Practitioners  with  solution-focused  or  narrative  orientations  tend  to  engage  
clients  in  conversations  that  lead  to  progressive  narratives  that  help  clients  make  
steady gains toward their goals. Therapists often ask clients: “Tell me about times 
when your life was going the way you wanted it to.” These conversations illustrate 
stories of life worth living. On the basis of these conversations, the power of prob-
lems is taken apart (deconstructed) and new directions and solutions are manifest 
and made possible.
Contributions of Postmodern Approaches
Social  constructionism,  SFBT,  and  narrative  therapy  are  making  many  contribu-
tions to the field of psychotherapy. I especially value the optimistic orientation of 
these postmodern approaches that rest on the assumptions that people are compe-
tent and can be trusted to use their resources in creating better solutions and more 
life-affirming stories. Many postmodern practitioners and writers have found that 
clients are able to make significant moves toward building more satisfying lives in a 
relatively short period of time (Bertolino & O’Hanlon, 2002; De Jong & Berg, 2013; 
de  Shazer,  1991;  Freedman  &  Combs,  1996;  Hoyt,  2009,  2015;  Miller,  Hubble,  &  
Duncan, 1996; O’Hanlon & Weiner-Davis, 2003; Walter & Peller, 1992, 2000; Win-
slade & Monk, 2007).
To its credit, solution-focused therapy is a brief approach, of about five sessions, 
that seems to show promising results (de Shazer, 1991). SFBT tends to be very brief, 
even  among  the  time-limited  therapies.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  brevity  comes  
from the client being in charge of goal setting and determining which issues are of 
immediate  concern.  This  differs  from  many  other  models  in  which  the  therapist  
determines the direction therapy should take.
I think the nonpathologizing stance characteristic of practitioners with a social 
constructionist,  solution-focused,  or  narrative  orientation  is  a  major  contribution  
to the counseling profession. Rather than dwelling on what is wrong with a person, 
these approaches view the client as being competent and resourceful. People cannot 
be reduced to a specific problem nor accurately labeled and identified with a disor-
der. Even practitioners who are expected to formulate a diagnosis can learn the value 
of a respectful way to relate to clients.
One  particular  area  where  the  solution-focused  approach  shows  promise  is  in  
group  treatment  with  domestic  violence  offenders.  Lee,  Sebold,  and  Uken  (2003)  
describe  a  cutting-edge  treatment  approach  that  seems  to  create  effective,  positive  
change in domestic violence offenders. This approach is dramatically different from 
traditional approaches in that there is virtually no emphasis on the presenting prob-
lem  of  domestic  violence.  The  approach  focuses  on  holding  offenders  accountable  
and responsible for building solutions rather than emphasizing their problems and 
deficits. The process described by Lee and colleagues is brief when measured against 
traditional  program  standards,  lasting  only  eight  sessions  over  a  10-  to  12-week  
period. Lee, Sebold, and Uken report research that indicates a recidivism rate of 16.7% 
and  completion  rates  of  92.9%.  In  contrast,  more  traditional  approaches  typically  
generate recidivism rates between 40 and 60% and completion rates of less than 50%.

A major strength of both solution-focused and narrative therapies is the use of 
questioning,  which  is  the  centerpiece  of  both  approaches.  Open-ended  questions  
about  the  client’s  attitudes,  thoughts,  feeling,  behaviors,  and  perceptions  are  one  
of  the  main  interventions.  Especially  useful  are  future-oriented  questions  that  get  
clients thinking about how they are likely to solve potential problems in the future. 
Questions can assist clients in developing their story and discovering better ways to 
deal  with  their  concerns.  Effective  questioning  can  help  individuals  examine  their  
story and find new ways to present it.
Limitation and Criticisms of Postmodern Approaches
To effectively practice solution-focused brief therapy, it is essential that therapists 
are skilled in brief interventions. Although it may appear that SFBT is simple and 
easy  to  implement,  therapists  practicing  within  this  framework  must  be  able  to  
make  assessments,  assist  clients  in  formulating  specific  goals,  and  effectively  use  
a  range  of  appropriate  interventions.  Some  inexperienced  or  untrained  therapists  
may be enamored by the variety of techniques: the miracle question, scaling ques-
tions, the exception question, and externalizing questions. But effective therapy is 
not  simply  a  matter  of  relying  on  any  of  these  interventions.  The  attitudes  of  the  
therapist and his or her ability to use questions that are reflective of genuine respect-
ful interest are crucial to the therapeutic process.
McKenzie and Monk (1997) express their concerns over those counselors who 
attempt to employ narrative ideas in a mechanistic fashion. They caution that a risk 
in  describing  a  map  of  a  narrative  orientation  lies  in  the  fact  that  some  beginners  
will pay more attention to following the map than they will to following the lead of 
the client. In such situations, McKenzie and Monk are convinced that mechanically 
using techniques will not be effective. They add that although narrative therapy is 
based  on  some  simple  ideas,  it  is  a  mistake  to  assume  that  the  practice  is  simple.  
Some  solution-focused  practitioners  now  acknowledge  the  problem  of  relying  too  
much on a few techniques, and they are placing increased importance on the thera-
peutic relationship and the overall philosophy of the approach (Lipchik, 2002; Mur-
phy, 2015).
Despite these limitations, the postmodern approaches have much to offer prac-
titioners, regardless of their theoretical orientation. Many of the basic concepts and 
techniques of both solution-focused brief therapy and narrative therapy can be inte-
grated into the other therapeutic orientations discussed in this book.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. Both solution-focused brief therapy and narrative therapy emphasize 
viewing the client-as-expert, creating new stories, establishing a collab-
orative therapeutic relationship, discovering resources and strengths of 
the client, and separating the problem from the person. What are your 
thoughts about these ideas?
2.
 What key concept are you most drawn to in SFBT? In narrative therapy? 
What do you find of interest in this key concept?

Introduction
Although  the  seeds  of  a  North  American  family  therapy  movement  were  
planted in the 1940s, it was during the 1950s that systemic family therapy began to 
take root (Becvar & Becvar, 2012). During the early years of its evolution, working with 
families was considered to be a revolutionary approach to treatment. In the 1960s and 
1970s,  psychodynamic,  behavioral,  and  humanistic  approaches  (called  the  first,  sec-
ond, and third force, respectively) dominated counseling and psychotherapy. Today, 
the  various  approaches  to  family  systems  represent  a  paradigm  shift  that  we  might  
even call the “fourth force.” Family systems therapy is represented by a variety of theo-
ries and approaches, all of which focus on the relational aspects of human problems.
The Family Systems Perspective
Perhaps  the  most  difficult  adjustment  for  counselors  and  therapists  from  
Western  cultures  is  the  adoption  of  a  “systems”  perspective.  Our  personal  experi-
ence and Western culture often tell us that we are autonomous individuals, capable 
of free and independent choice. And yet we are born into families—and most of us 
live our entire lives attached to one form of family or another. Within these families, 
we discover who we are; we develop and change; and we give and receive the support 
we need for survival. We create, maintain, and live by often unspoken rules and rou-
tines that we hope will keep the family (and each of its members) functional.
A family systems perspective holds that individuals are best understood through 
assessing the interactions between and among family members. The development and 
behavior of one family member is inextricably interconnected with others in the fam-
ily. Symptoms are often viewed as an expression of a set of habits and patterns within 
a  family.  It  is  revolutionary  to  conclude  that  the  identified  client’s  problem  might  
be a symptom of how the system functions, not just a symptom of the individual’s 
maladjustment, history, and psychosocial development. This perspective is grounded 
on the assumptions that a client’s problematic behavior may (1) serve a function or 
purpose for the family; (2) be unintentionally maintained by family processes; (3) be 
a  function  of  the  family’s  inability  to  operate  productively,  especially  during  devel-
opmental transitions; or (4) be a symptom of dysfunctional patterns handed down 
across generations. All these assumptions challenge the more traditional intrapsychic 
frameworks for conceptualizing human problems and their formation.
The central principle agreed upon by family therapy practitioners, regardless of 
their particular approach, is that the client is connected to living systems. Attempts 
at  change  are  best  facilitated  by  working  with  and  considering  the  family  or  set  of  
relationships  as  a  whole.  Therefore,  a  treatment  approach  that  comprehensively  
addresses the family as well as the “identified” client is required. Because a family is 
an interactional unit, it has its own set of unique traits. It is not possible to accurately 
assess an individual’s concern without observing the interaction of the other family 
members, as well as the broader contexts in which the person and the family live.
Family therapy perspectives call for a conceptual shift from evaluating individu-
als to focusing on system dynamics, or how individuals within a system react to one 
another.  Actions  by  any  individual  family  member  will  influence  all  family  mem-
bers, and their reactions will have a reciprocal effect on the individual. When change

port the family system and the new behaviors of the individual or family (Lambert, 
Carmichael,  &  Williams,  2016).  Goldenberg  and  Goldenberg  (2013)  point  to  the  
need  for  therapists  to  view  all  behavior,  including  all  symptoms  expressed  by  the  
individual, within the context of the family and society. They add that a systems ori-
entation does not preclude dealing with the dynamics within the individual, but that 
this approach broadens the traditional emphasis on individual internal dynamics.

Differences Between Systemic and Individual Approaches
There are significant differences between individual therapeutic approaches 
and systemic approaches. A case may help to illustrate these differences. Ann, age 22, 
sees a counselor because she is suffering from a depression that has lasted for more 
than two years and has impaired her ability to maintain friendships and work pro-
ductively. She wants to feel better, but she is pessimistic about her chances. How will 
a therapist choose to help her?
Both the individual therapist and the systemic therapist are interested in Ann’s 
current living situation and life experiences. Both discover that she is still living at 
home with her parents, who are in their 60s. They note that she has a very successful 
older sister, who is a prominent lawyer in the small town in which the two live. The 
therapists  are  impressed  by  Ann’s  loss  of  friends  who  have  married  and  left  town  
over the years while she stayed behind, often lonely and isolated. Finally, both thera-
pists note that Ann’s depression affects others as well as herself. It is here, however, 
that the similarities tend to end:

406            CHAPTER FOURTEEn
Systemic therapists do not deny the importance of the individual in the family 
system,  but  they  believe  an  individual’s  systemic  affiliations  and  interactions  have  
more power in the person’s life than a single therapist could ever hope to have. By 
working  with  the  whole  family  (or  even  community)  system,  the  therapist  has  a  
chance  to  observe  how  individuals  act  within  the  system  and  participate  in  main-
taining  the  status  quo;  how  the  system  influences  (and  is  influenced  by)  the  indi-
vidual; and what interventions might lead to changes that help the couple, family, 
or larger system as well as the individual expressing pain.
In  Ann’s  case,  her  depression  may  have  organic,  genetic,  or  hormonal  compo-
nents. It may also involve cognitive, experiential, or behavioral patterns that inter-
fere  with  effective  coping.  Even  if  her  depression  can  be  explained  in  this  manner,  
however, the systemic therapist is very interested in how her depression affects oth-
ers in the family and how it influences family processes. Her depression may signal 
both  her  own  pain  and  the  unexpressed  pain  of  the  family.  Indeed,  many  family  
system approaches would investigate how the depression serves other family mem-
bers; distracts from problems in the intimate relationships of others; or reflects her 
need to adjust to family rules, to cultural injunctions, or to processes influenced by 
gender or family life-cycle development. Rather than losing sight of the individual, 
family therapists understand the person as specifically embedded in larger systems.
Development of Family Systems Therapy
Family systems theory has evolved throughout the past 100 years, and today 
therapists  creatively  employ  various  perspectives  when  tailoring  therapy  to  a  par-
ticular  family.  Alfred  Adler  (1927)  and  Rudolf  Dreikurs  (1950,  1973)  and  their  
associates were the first known practitioners of family therapy, often using a model 
now  called  open-forum  family  counseling  (Christensen,  2004).  Adler  introduced  
phenomenology  to  our  understanding  of  the  family  system  (or  family  constella-
tion). Assessment is based on the subjective descriptions that family members use to 
define themselves and the interactions that occur in everyday life. It is within these 
interactions that Adlerians seek to discover the purposes and goals of behavior (Bit-
ter, 2014; Bitter, Roberts, & Sonstegard, 2002).
Take a moment and think about two different family experiences in your own 
life. When you were little, what descriptions would you have used for your parents? 
What do these descriptions tell you about what was important to you? Let’s say that 
one’s  father  is  described  as  kind,  generous,  and  childlike.  The  mother  is  described  
as  beautiful,  very  hard  working,  and  sacrificing.  No  adjective  or  description  exists  
outside  of  the  relationship.  When  the  person  says  the  father  was  kind,  this  means  
that the father was kind to the person as a child. When the mother is described as 
very hard working, the person is suggesting that access to mother was difficult to get. 
Still, mother’s hard work has a purpose: she is sacrificing for the child. What else can 
we know from these descriptions? Father was generous and childlike: “he played with 
me.”  He  may  not  have  been  very  oriented  toward  discipline.  Mother  was  beautiful. 
The message is that for women appearances are important.
Now,  think  about  your  current  family  situation,  either  your  family  of  origin  
or a new family you have started. What descriptions would family members use to

describe you? What does that tell you about your place or role in the family? Finally, 
think about a recent family interaction that was difficult for you. What goals or pur-
poses did you have for your part of the interaction? What goals or purposes might 
have  been  involved  for  those  interacting  with  you?  You  can  generally  discover  the  
goal or purpose of behavior by looking at the consequence of that behavior in the 
responses of others: “What do people do when I act in one way or another?”
We now take a look at the most prominent models and what they have contrib-
uted to the evolution of family systems therapy.
MURRAY BOWEN (1913–1990) believed 
families could best be understood when 
analyzed  from  a  three-generation  per-
spective  because  patterns  of  interper-
sonal    relationships    connect    family    
members   across   generations.   Two   of   
his  objectives  in  therapy  were  to  help  
family   members   develop   a   rational,   
nonreactive approach to living (called a 
differentiation  of  self)  and  to  de-tangle  
family  interactions  that  involved  two  
people  pulling  a  third  person  into  the  
couple’s  problems  and  arguments  (or  
triangulation).
Bowen’s  observations  led  to  his  interest  in  pat-
terns   across   multiple   generations.   He   contended   
that  problems  manifested  in  one’s  current  family  
will  not  significantly  change  until  relationship  pat-
terns  in  one’s  family  of  origin  are  understood  and  
directly  challenged.  His  approach  operates  on  the  
premise  that  a  predictable  pattern  of  interpersonal  
relationships   connects   the   functioning   of   family   
members  across  generations.  According  to  Kerr  and  
Bowen  (1988),  the  cause  of  an  individual’s  prob-
lems  can  be  understood  only  by  viewing  the  role  of  
the  family  as  an  emotional  unit.  Within  the  family  
unit,  unresolved  emotional  reactivity  to  one’s  family  
must  be  addressed  if  one  hopes  to  achieve  a  mature  
and  unique  personality.  Emotional  problems  will  be  
transmitted  from  generation  to  genera-
tion  until  unresolved  emotional  attach-
ments  are  dealt  with  effectively.  Change  
must  occur  with  other  family  members  
and cannot be done by an individual in a 
counseling room.
Murray Bowen (1978) was one of the 
original  developers  of  mainstream  family  
therapy. His family systems theory, which 
is  a  theoretical  and  clinical  model  that  
evolved   from   psychoanalytic   principles   
and  practices,  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  
multigenerational   family   therapy.   The   
goal of this approach is to differentiate self within a sys-
tem  and  to  understand  one’s  family  of  origin.  Bowen  
and his associates implemented an innovative approach 
to  schizophrenia  at  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  
Health  where  Bowen  hospitalized  entire  families  so  
that the family system could be the focus of therapy.
Bowen’s  emphasis  on  a  multigenerational  per-
spective laid a foundation for work by two of Bowen’s 
most prominent colleagues, Betty Carter and Monica 
McGoldrick,  who  almost  single-handedly  initiated  
both  a  developmental  and  a  multicultural  perspec-
tive  in  family  therapy.  Indeed,  McGoldrick’s  work  
includes  the  field’s  most  important  work  on  geno-
grams  (McGoldrick,  Gerson,  &  Petry,  2008),  family  
life cycle (McGoldrick, Carter, & Garcia-Preto, 2011), 
and gender (McGoldrick, Anderson, & Walsh, 1991).

VIRGINIA   SATIR   (1916–1988)   developed   conjoint   
family therapy, a human validation process model 
that emphasizes communication and emotional expe-
riencing.  Like  Bowen,  she  used  an  intergenerational  
model, but she worked to bring family patterns to life 
in  the  present  through  sculpting  and  family  recon-
structions. Claiming that techniques were secondary 
to  relationship,  she  concentrated  on  the  personal  
relationship between therapist and family to achieve 
change. The core of Satir’s model relied on the power 
of congruence to help family members communicate 
with  emotional  honesty.  Her  presence  with  people  
encouraged them to get in touch with what was sig-
nificant within, to become more fully human, and to

Structural-Strategic Family Therapy
The  origins  of  structural  family  therapy  can  be  traced  to  the  early  1960s  when  
Salvador Minuchin was conducting therapy, training, and research with delinquent 
boys  from  poor  families  at  the  Wiltwyck  School  in  New  York.  Minuchin’s  (1974)  
central idea was that an individual’s symptoms are best understood from the van-
tage point of interactional patterns, or sequences, within a family. He further stated 
that structural changes must occur in a family before an individual’s symptoms can 
be reduced or eliminated. The goals of structural family therapy include (1) reduc-
ing symptoms of dysfunction and (2) bringing about structural change within the 
system by modifying the family’s transactional rules and establishing more appro-
priate boundaries.
In the late 1960s, Jay Haley joined Minuchin at the Philadelphia Child Guidance 
Clinic.  The  work  of  Haley  and  Minuchin  shared  so  many  similarities  in  goals  and  
process that many clinicians in the 1980s and 1990s began to question whether the 
two models were distinct schools of thought. Indeed, by the late 1970s, structural-
strategic  approaches  were  the  most  used  models  in  family  systems  therapy.  The  
interventions  generated  in  these  models  became  synonymous  with  a  systems  
approach; they included joining, boundary setting, unbalancing, reframing, ordeals, 
paradoxical interventions, and enactments.
If  you  divided  your  family  of  origin  into  subsystems,  who  would  be  in  the  
parental  subsystem?  The  spousal  subsystem?  The  sibling  subsystem?  What  
rules  and  boundaries  were  set  around  each  subsystem?  Were  the  boundaries  
ever crossed? By whom and with what result? What were common interactional 
sequences  in  your  family?  Who  had  the  power  in  your  family,  and  how  was  it  
exercised? Who was aligned with whom, and what did they use that alignment 
to achieve? These are just a few of the assessments structural-strategic therapists 
taught us to consider.
share  the  individual’s  best  self  with  a  
significant other. Satir called this experi-
ence “making contact,” and she believed 
that   it   extended   the   peace   one   had   
within  to  a  peace  between  people  and,  
eventually, to a peace among people.
At about the same time that Bowen 
was  developing  his  approach,  Virginia  
Satir (1983) began emphasizing family 
connection.  Her  therapeutic  work  had  
already led her to believe in the value of 
a  strong,  nurturing  relationship  based  
on  interest  and  fascination  with  those  
in her care. Unlike Bowen, Satir could envision and 
sought  to  support  the  development  of  a  nurturing  
triad:  two  people,  for  example  parents,  
working  for  the  well-being  of  another,  
perhaps  a  child.  Satir  thought  of  herself  
as  a  detective  who  sought  out  and  lis-
tened  for  the  reflections  of  self-esteem  
in   the   communication   of   her   clients.   
She   placed   a   strong   emphasis   on   the   
importance of communication and meta-
communication   in   family   interactions,   
and  the  value  of  therapeutic  validation  
in  the  process  of  change  (Satir  &  Bitter,  
2000).  From  Satir,  family  therapy  gets  it  
model for empathic listening, therapeutic 
presence, and nurturance (Satir, Banmen, Gerber, & 
Gomori, 1991).

Recent Innovations in Family Therapy
In the last decade, feminism, multiculturalism, and postmodern social constructionism  
have  all  entered  the  family  therapy  field.  These  models  are  more  collaborative,  
treating clients—individuals, couples, or families—as experts in their own lives. The 
therapeutic conversations start with the counselor in a “not-knowing” position in 
which  clients  are  approached  with  curiosity  and  interest.  The  therapist  is  socially  
active and aids clients in taking a preferred stand in relation to the dominant cul-
ture  that  may  be  oppressing  them.  Therapy  often  incorporates  “reflecting  teams”  
and “definitional ceremonies” to bring multiple perspectives to the work (see West, 
Bubenzer, & Bitter, 1998).
Feminist, multicultural, and postmodern therapists are extremely aware of the 
power  they  have  entering  into  already  established  systems,  and  they  work  to  pro-
mote  understanding  through  curiosity  and  interest  rather  than  through  formal  
assessments. Adopting a decentered position allows them to be part of the system 
without taking it over.
Postmodern approaches to family therapy, like narrative therapy, seek to reduce 
or eliminate the power and impact of the family therapist. Taken together, postmod-
ern approaches represent a real paradigm shift in the field of family therapy.
This brief discussion of the various systemic viewpoints in family therapy pro-
vides  a  context  for  understanding  the  development  of  family  therapy.  For  an  in-
depth  treatment  of  the  schools  of  family  therapy,  see  Theory  and  Practice  of  Family  
Therapy  and  Counseling  (Bitter,  2014)  and  the  recommended  readings  at  the  end  of  
the chapter.
A Multilayered Process of Family Therapy
Families  are  multilayered  systems  that  both  affect  and  are  affected  by  the  
larger  systems  in  which  they  are  embedded.  Families  can  be  described  in  terms  of  
their individual members and the various roles they play, the relationships between 
the members, and the sequential patterns of the interactions and the purposes these 
sequences serve. Both the members and the system can be assessed based on power, 
alignment,  organization,  structure,  development,  culture,  and  gender  (Breunlin,  
Schwartz, & MacKune-Karrer, 1997). Even individuals can be considered from the 
perspective of an internal family system (Schwartz, 1995). In addition, nuclear fami-
lies in a global community are often part of extended, if distant, families; multiple 
families make up a community; multiple communities make up both regions and 
cultures, which in turn constitute nations (or societies). The power of these macro-
systems to influence family life—especially in the areas of gender and culture—is sig-
nificant. Given our presuppositions about families and the larger systems in which 
families are embedded, a multilayered approach to family therapy is essential.
Several forms and structures have been proposed for integrative models of fam-
ily  counseling  and  therapy  (e.g.,  Carlson,  Sperry,  &  Lewis,  2005;  Gladding,  2014;  
Hanna, 2007; Nichols, 2013). The integrative model we have chosen to present here 
allows for an enlarged integration of ideas from multiple models of family therapy. 
Similar to a piece of classical music, the process of family therapy, it seems to us, has

movements. These movements can be described as separate experiences embedded in 
the larger flow of therapy. In this section we describe four general movements, each 
with different tasks: forming a relationship, conducting an assessment, hypothesiz-
ing and sharing meaning, and facilitating change. In rare instances, these four move-
ments might occur within a single session; in most cases, however, each movement 
requires multiple sessions.
Forming a Relationship
Over  the  years,  family  systems  therapists  have  used  a  wide  range  of  metaphors  to  
describe the role of the therapist and the therapeutic relationship. The emergence of 
feminist and postmodern models in therapy has moved the field of family therapy 
toward  more  egalitarian,  collaborative,  cooperative,  co-constructing  relationships  
(see  T.  Andersen,  1987,  1991;  H.  Anderson,  1993;  Anderson  &  Goolishian,  1992;  
Epston & White, 1992; Luepnitz, 1988/2002).
The  debate  Carl  Rogers  (1980)  first  introduced  to  individual  therapy  in  the  
1940s has reemerged within family therapy in the form of these questions:
What expertise does the therapist have in relation to the family, and 
how should that expertise be used?
How directive should therapists be in relation to families, and what 
does that say about the uses of power in therapy?
We believe a multilayered approach to family therapy is best supported by a col-
laborative  therapist–client  relationship  in  which  mutual  respect,  caring,  empathy,  
and a genuine interest in others is primary. In addition, we believe directed actions and 
enactments are most useful when they are a joint venture of both the therapist and 
the family.
Therapists  begin  to  form  a  relationship  with  clients  from  the  moment  of  
first contact. In most cases, we believe therapists should make their own appoint-
ments, answer initial questions clients may have, and give clients a sense of what 
to expect when they come for their first session. This is also a time when coun-
selors  can  let  families  know  their  position  on  whether  all  members  should  be  
present. Some family therapists will work with any of those members of the fam-
ily who wish to come; others will only see the family if everyone is a part of the 
therapy session.
From  the  moment  of  first  face-to-face  contact,  good  therapeutic  relation-
ships start with efforts at making contact with each person present (Satir & Bitter, 
2000). Whether it is called joining, engagement, or simple care and concern, it is the 
therapist’s responsibility to meet each person with openness and warmth. Gener-
ally,  a  focused  interest  on  each  family  member  helps  to  reduce  the  anxiety  the  
family may be feeling.
Therapeutic  process  and  structure  are  part  of  the  therapist’s  job  description.  
It  is  important  for  family  members  to  introduce  themselves  and  to  express  their  
concerns, but the therapist should not focus too tightly on content issues. Under-
standing  family  process  is  almost  always  facilitated  by  how  questions.  Questions  
that  begin  with  what, why, where,  or  when  tend  to  overemphasize  content  details  
(Gladding, 2014).

All  change  in  human  systems  starts  with  understanding  and  accepting  
things  just  as  they  are  (Satir  &  Baldwin,  1983).  The  family  practitioner’s  skill  
in  communicating  that  understanding  and  empathy  through  active  listening  
lays the foundation for an effective working relationship. Those counselors and 
therapists  who  use  validation  and  encouragement,  who  support  family  resil-
ience, and who elicit cooperation experience the greatest amount of success in 
therapy.
Conducting an Assessment
The multiple layers we have noted provide numerous entry points for conducting 
family  assessments,  but  beginning  counselors  and  therapists  will  often  find  that  
more formal assessment procedures, such as genograms (McGoldrick et al., 2008), 
enable  the  family  structure  and  stories  to  be  presented  in  a  clearer,  more  orderly  
manner.  In  some  cases,  formal  tests  and  rating  scales  also  can  be  useful  (see,  for  
example, Gottman, 1999).
Let’s start with the process for co-constructing a genogram. Most family practi-
tioners start with a map of the family that comes to therapy. The parents are listed 
with  their  name,  age,  and  date  of  birth  in  either  a  rectangle  (for  men)  or  a  circle  
(for women). If there are multiple relationships involved in the parental subsystem, 
they are generally indicated in chronological order with men listed on the left and 
women on the right.
Ralph  
Age 30 
1/17/81
John  
Age 25 
2/27/86
Mary  
Age 24 
12/22/87
m. 2006//d. 2008 m. 2010
In the above genogram, Mary married Ralph when she was 20 and Ralph was 26; 
their marriage lasted about two years, and then they were divorced. In 2010, Mary 
and John were married. If John and Mary had decided to live together, but not com-
mit to a formal marriage, the genogram would use a broken line (or dashes) to indi-
cate an informal relationship, like this:
John  
Age 25 
2/27/86
Mary  
Age 24 
12/22/87
If Ralph had died instead of divorcing Mary, it would look like this:
Ralph  
Age 30 
1/17/81
Mary  
Age 24 
12/22/87
d. 2008

When Mary and John have children, their genogram may look like this:

Ann

In the above genogram, it is now 2016, and John and Mary have been married 
for six years. When they had been married for one year, Mary gave birth to their first 
child, a boy that they named John Jr. A year later, Mary had a miscarriage, indicated 
by a black oval at the end of a child line. Two years ago, they adopted (indicated by 
a solid line next to a broken line) their daughter Ann. If we extend John and Mary’s 
genogram to three generations and if we assume that both John and Mary were only 
children, the basic three generation family genogram would look like this:
John  
Age 30 
2/27/86
John, Jr.  
Age 5 
4/20/11
Mary

Many  other  symbols  are  used  in  a  genogram,  including  a  double  square  or  a  
double  circle  to  indicate  the  index  person,  or  person  on  whom  the  genogram  is  
focused. An upside down triangle in a square or circle is used to indicate a gay man 
or a lesbian woman. We shade the bottom half of a square or circle to indicate sub-
stance abuse. We use double parallel lines to indicate a strong relationship between 
two people and three parallel lines to indicate a fused or enmeshed relationship. A 
dotted line indicates a distant relationship, and conflict is indicated with lines that 
look like this: /\/\/\/\/\/\/. Later in the chapter we use a genogram in our work with 
Stan, but you now have enough information to construct your own genogram, and 
we highly recommend that you get a large piece of paper and get started. It works 
best if two people interview each other so that you are both drawing the genogram 
and telling each other the story of your family.

As  the  therapist  listens  to  family  members  describe  the  story  of  their  family,  it  
may be difficult to know where to start with a family. Family members are often the 
best people to choose a focus. Family practitioners may use circular or relational ques-
tioning  to  get  at  the  systemic  issues  presented  in  the  family  story  that  will  provide  
meaning for the therapist and the family. For example, suppose Tammy is upsetting 
the family system by ignoring the curfew her parents have set for her. The therapist 
might ask: “What will happen if Tammy stays out past curfew and is picked up by the 
police? Who will be most upset by this?” Here is Tammy’s father’s reply:
I will probably be the most upset on the outside. I tend to go off before I think, 
and then I regret it later. On the other hand, her mother may not show it imme-
diately, but her hurt will stay with her longer, and then she will get mad at me for 
“letting Tammy off the hook.” She will say that Tammy is manipulating me, but 
I just don’t see why we should keep fighting about things. It doesn’t do any good. 
We  fight,  and  Tammy  disappears.  She  wants  to  run  with  the  big  kids,  some  of  
whom are in college, over 18, and have no curfew.
From this father’s response, the therapist can choose from a number of points 
of  entry  into  the  life  of  this  family.  The  counselor  might  choose  to  work  with  the  
anger or guilt expressed by the members and present in their interactions. Sequen-
tial patterns were clearly articulated by the father when the family members are try-
ing to resolve conflict and handle problems. His description also includes implied 
positions  on  the  roles  of  men,  women,  and  female  children  in  families—as  well  as  
developmental issues related to Tammy wanting to be older than she is.
In the assessment process, it is helpful to inquire about family perspectives on 
issues  inherent  in  each  of  these  layers.  In  addition  to  the  points  of  entry  we  have  
noted,  here  are  some  other  questions  that  might  be  included  in  a  more  detailed  
assessment.
What does each family member bring to the session?
How does each person describe who he or she is?
What are the goals of each family member? What goals does each fam-
ily member have for the other people in the family?
What routines support the daily living of each member of the family?
Who makes decisions? How are conflicts resolved or problems handled?
What parts are involved in the most common sequences in the family?
What is a typical day like?
Are the parents effective leaders of the family, and is the process of lead-
ership balanced or imbalanced?
How do the children respond to parental leadership? What are the chil-
dren’s goals in responding the way they do?
Where is each person in the family in relation to personal biological, 
cognitive, emotional, and social development?
Where is the family in the family life cycle, and how are they handling 
transitions?
What cultures are in the family backgrounds of each of the family 
members?
In what culture or region is the family currently living, and is immigra-
tion or migration a recent family experience?

How do economics, education, ethnicity, religion, race, regional back-
ground, gender, sexual orientation, ableness, and age affect family 
processes—and how is the fit between the family practitioner and the 
family with regard to these aspects of family life?
What effects has racism, patriarchy, or heterosexism had on this family 
and its members?
What ideas in relation to gender need to be affirmed or challenged?
Where is this family in the process of change?
What resources (internal or external) need to be accessed?
Hypothesizing and Sharing Meaning
To hypothesize is to form a set of ideas about people, systems, and situations that 
focus meaning in a useful way. In family therapy, hypothesizing flows from the ideas 
and  understandings  generated  in  the  assessment  process.  Two  questions  are  ger-
mane to the form of hypothesizing one chooses to do: (1) How much faith do the 
therapist and the family have in the ideas they generate? (2) How much of an influ-
ence is the therapist willing to be in the lives of people and families?
Family  counselors,  like  individual  therapists,  cannot  avoid  influencing  the  
family and its members. But what kind of influence will the therapist bring to the 
session? Satir and Bitter (2000) suggest that family therapists cannot be in charge 
of  the  people,  but  they  need  to  be  in  charge  of  the  process;  that  is,  they  own  the  
responsibility for how therapy is conducted. Feminists and social constructionists 
are,  perhaps,  the  most  expressive  of  their  concerns  about  the  misuse  of  power  in  
therapy. They are joined by multiculturalists, person-centered therapists, Adlerians, 
and existentialists, to name a few, who have also witnessed the often unconscious 
imposition  of  “dominant  culture”  in  therapy.  In  the  early  days  of  family  therapy,  
the  mostly  male  therapists  often  ignored  the  effects  on  family  life  of  patriarchy,  
poverty, racism, cultural discrimination and marginalization, homo-prejudice, and 
other  societal  problems.  At  the  strategic-structural  end  of  the  continuum,  thera-
pists  were  more  likely  to  claim  a  certain  expertise  in  systems  work  that  allowed  
them  to  make  direct  interventions  in  the  enactment  of  “needed”  changes  in  the  
family. To counteract therapeutic abuses and what some perceived to be an ongo-
ing misuse of power in therapy, some narrative therapists adopted a decentered posi-
tion in relation to the family (White, 1997, 2007). Like person-centered therapists 
before them, decentered therapists seek to keep families and family members at the 
center of the therapeutic process.
It is important for families to be invited into respectful, essentially collaborative 
dialogues  in  therapeutic  work.  The  different  perspectives  discovered  in  this  work  
tend to coalesce into working hypotheses, and sharing these ideas provides the fam-
ily  with  a  window  into  the  heart  and  mind  of  the  therapist  as  well  as  themselves.  
Sharing hypotheses almost immediately invites and invokes feedback from various 
family  members.  And  it  is  this  feedback  that  enables  the  therapist  and  the  family  
to  develop  a  good  fit  with  each  other,  which  in  turn  tends  to  cement  a  working  
relationship.
The  tentative  hypothesizing  and  sharing  process  that  Dreikurs  (1950,  1997)  
developed  is  well  designed  for  the  kind  of  collaborative  work  envisioned  here.

Dreikurs would use a passionate interest and curiosity to ask questions and gather 
together the subjective perspectives of family members. Indeed, he would honor the 
ideas  that  individuals  brought  to  their  joint  understanding.  When  he  had  an  idea  
that he wanted to share, he would often seek permission for his disclosure:
1.
 I have an idea I would like to share with you. Would you be willing to 
hear it?
2. Could it be that . . .
The value of this way of presenting hypotheses is that it invites families and family 
members  to  consider  and  to  engage  without  giving  up  their  right  to  discard  any-
thing that does not fit. When a suggested idea does not fit, the therapist is then clear 
about letting it go and letting the family redirect the conversation toward more use-
ful conceptualizations.
Facilitating Change
Facilitating change is what happens when family therapy is viewed as a joint or col-
laborative process. Techniques are more important to models that see the therapist-
as-expert  and  in  charge  of  making  change  happen.  Collaborative  approaches  require  
planning.  “Planning  can  still  include  what  family  therapy  has  called  techniques  or  
interventions, but with the family’s participation” (Breunlin et al., 1997, p. 292). Two 
of  the  most  common  forms  for  facilitation  of  change  are  enactments  and  assign-
ment  of  tasks.  Both  of  these  processes  work  best  when  the  family  co-constructs  
them with the therapist—or at least accepts the rationale for their use.
Within the change process, the number of possible outcomes is only limited by 
the resources available internally and externally to the family. This does not mean, 
however, that the family practitioner is without a guide for preferred or desired out-
comes.  In  general,  the  internal  parts  of  family  members  function  best  when  they  
are  balanced  (not  polarized)  and  when  the  individual  experiences  personal  parts  
as  resources.  Being  able  to  think  is  usually  more  useful  than  emotional  reactivity;  
being able to feel is better than not feeling; good contact with others is more reward-
ing  than  isolation  or  self-absorption;  and  taking  reasonable  risks  in  the  service  of  
growth and development is more beneficial than stagnation or a retreat into fear.
Further, knowing the goals and purposes for our behaviors, feelings, and inter-
actions  tends  to  give  us  choices  about  their  use.  And  understanding  the  patterns  
we  enact  in  face-to-face  relationships,  the  ebbs  and  flows  of  life,  or  across  genera-
tions provide multiple avenues for challenging patterns and the enactment of new 
possibilities.
Family Systems Therapy From a Multicultural Perspective
Strengths From a Diversity Perspective
One  of  the  strengths  of  the  systemic  perspective  in  working  from  a  multi-
cultural  framework  is  that  many  ethnic  and  cultural  groups  place  great  value  on  
the  extended  family.  If  therapists  are  working  with  an  individual  from  a  cultural  
background  that  gives  special  value  to  including  grandparents,  aunts,  and  uncles

in the treatment, it is easy to see that family approaches have a distinct advantage 
over  individual  therapy.  Family  therapists  can  do  some  excellent  networking  with  
members of the extended family.
Within the field of family therapy, Monica McGoldrick has been the most influ-
ential leader in the development of both gender and cultural perspectives and frame-
works in family practice (see McGoldrick et al., 1991, 2005; McGoldrick, & Hardy, 
2008). In many ways, McGoldrick and her colleagues approach families like systems 
anthropologists. They see each family as a unique culture whose particular charac-
teristics  must  be  understood.  Like  larger  cultural  systems,  families  have  a  unique  
language  that  governs  behavior,  communication,  and  even  how  to  feel  about  and  
experience life. Families have celebrations and rituals that mark transitions, protect 
them  against  outside  interference,  and  connect  them  to  their  past  as  well  as  to  a  
projected future.
Similarly,  families  cannot  escape  the  sexism  and  patriarchy  that  are  inherent  
in  all  cultures.  The  roles  for  men  and  women  are  prescribed  in  different  societies,  
but  in  every  culture  women  tend  to  come  out  on  the  short  end  more  often  than  
not. The roles that women as mothers play in the family, in the world of work, and 
in the community set the model for female children often for generations to come. 
Because family life is where the roles of women can be most limited, a consideration 
of gender issues in families is an essential framework for family therapy (McGold-
rick et al., 1991). Perhaps the most difficult integration of all is figuring out how to 
honor different cultures in therapy without supporting marginalization or oppres-
sion of women. Toward this end, it is important to remember that there are feminist 
voices in every culture throughout the world.
Just as differentiation means coming to understand our family well enough to 
be a part of it—to belong—and also to separate and be our own person, understand-
ing cultures allows therapists and families to appreciate diversity and to contextu-
alize  family  experiences  in  relation  to  the  larger  cultures.  Today,  family  therapists  
explore the individual culture of the family, the larger cultures to which the family 
members  belong,  and  the  host  culture  that  dominates  the  family’s  life.  They  look  
for ways in which culture can both inform and modify family work. Interventions 
are no longer applied universally, regardless of the cultures involved: rather, they are 
adapted and even designed to join with the cultural systems.
Shortcomings From a Diversity Perspective
Given  the  multicultural  focus  and  collaborative  approach  of  family  systems  ther-
apy,  it  is  difficult  to  find  shortcomings  from  a  diversity  perspective.  This  model  
of  family  therapy  embraces  attitudes,  knowledge,  and  skills  that  are  essential  to  
a  multicultural  perspective.  Perhaps  the  major  concern  for  non-Western  cultures  
would  be  with  regard  to  the  balance  that  this  model  advocates  for  the  individual  
versus  the  collective.  The  process  of  differentiation  occurs  in  most  cultures,  but  
it  takes  on  a  different  shape  due  to  cultural  norms.  For  instance,  a  young  person  
may become separate from her parents yet not move out of the house. When eth-
nic-minority families immigrate to North America, their children often adapt to a 
Western concept of differentiation. In such cases, the intergenerational process of 
therapy is appropriate if the therapist is sensitive to the family-of-origin’s cultural

roots. Although a multilayered approach addresses the notion of togetherness and 
individuality  from  a  balanced  perspective,  many  non-Western  cultures  would  not  
embrace a theory that valued individuality above loyalty to family in any form. Nor 
would non-Western cultures have the same conceptualizations of time or even emo-
tions. Therapists, regardless of their model of therapy, must find ways to enter the 
family’s world and honor the traditions that support the family.
A possible shortcoming of the practice of family therapy involves practitioners 
who assume Western models of family are universal. Indeed, there are many cultural 
variations to family structure, processes, and communication. Family therapists are 
finding ways to broaden their views of individuation, appropriate gender roles, fam-
ily life cycles, and extended families. Some family therapists focus primarily on the 
nuclear family, which is based on Western notions, and this could clearly be a short-
coming in working with clients in extended families.
I
n  our  work  with  Stan  in  this  modality,  we  include  
examples  of  forming  a  relationship  and  joining,  
reading  Stan’s  genogram,  a  multilayered  assessment,  
reframing,  boundary  setting  in  therapy,  and  facilitat-
ing  change.  There  are  many  useful  models  and  ways  
to work with families; this discussion represents some 
possible  ways  to  work  with  Stan  from  a  multilayered  
perspective.
At  an  intake  interview,  a  family  therapist  meets  
with  Stan  to  explore  his  issues  and  concerns  and  to  
learn  more  about  him  and  his  life  situation.  As  they  
talk, the therapist brings an intense interest and curios-
ity to the interview and wonders out loud about the fa-
milial roots of some of Stan’s problems. It does not take 
much of an inquiry to learn that Stan is still very much 
engaged  with  his  parents  and  siblings,  no  matter  how  
difficult  these  relationships  have  been  for  him.  This  
initial conversation involves the development of a geno-
gram  of  Stan’s  family  of  origin  (see  Figure  14.1).  This  
map will serve both Stan and the therapist as a guide to 
the people and the processes that influence Stan’s life.
Stan’s genogram is really a family picture, or map, 
of  his  family-of-origin  system.  In  this  genogram,  we  
learn that Stan’s grandparents tend to have lived fairly 
long lives. Stan’s maternal grandparents are both alive. 
The  shaded  lower  half  of  their  square  and  circle  indi-
cates that each had some problem with alcohol. In the 
case of Tom, Stan reports that he was an admitted al-
coholic who recommitted himself to Christ and found 
help through Alcoholics Anonymous. Stan’s maternal 
grandmother  always  drank  a  little  socially  and  with  
her husband, but she never considered herself to have 
a problem. In her later years, however, she seems to se-
cretly use alcohol more and more, and it is a source of 
distress  in  her  marriage.  Stan  also  knows  that  Margie  
drinks a lot, because he has been drinking with his aunt 
for years. She is the one who gave him his first drink.
Angie,  Stan’s  mother,  married  Frank  Sr.  after  he  
had  stopped  drinking,  also  with  the  help  of  AA.  He  
still  goes  to  meetings.  Angie  is  suspicious  of  all  men  
around  alcohol.  She  is  especially  upset  with  Stan  
and with Judy’s husband, Matt, who “also drinks too 
much.” The genogram makes it easy to see the pattern 
of alcohol problems in this family.
The  jagged  lines  /\/\/\/\  between  Frank  Sr.  and  
Angie  indicate  conflict  in  the  relationship.  The  three  
solid  lines  ===  between  Frank  Sr.  and  Frank  Jr.,  and  
between  Angie  and  Karl,  indicate  a  very  close  or  even  
fused  relationship.  The  double  lines  ====  between  
Karl  and  Stan  are  used  to  note  a  close  relationship  
only.  As  we  will  see,  Karl  actually  looks  up  to  Stan  in  
this family. The dotted lines . . . . . between Frank Sr. 
and  Stan  and  between  Frank  Jr.  and  Stan  indicate  a  
distant or even disengaged relationship.
Because the family therapist believes that the whole 
family is involved in Stan’s use of alcohol, she spends a 
good  part  of  the  first  session  exploring  with  Stan  pro-
cesses  for  asking  his  other  family  members  to  join  him  
in  therapy.  Stan  may  have  many  difficulties,  but  at  the  
moment his difficulty with alcohol is the primary focus.

Alcohol  is  a  negative  part  of  his  life,  and  as  such  it  has  
systemic meaning. It may have started out as a symptom 
of  other  problems,  but  now  the  alcohol  is  a  problem  
in  itself.  From  a  systemic  perspective,  the  questions  are  
“How  does  this  problem  affect  the  family?”  and  “Is  the  
family using this problem to serve some other purpose?”
In  the  first  therapy  session  with  the  family,  the  
therapist’s  main  focus  is  in  forming  a  relationship  
with each of the family members, but even here, a vari-
ety of approaches present themselves.
Therapist [to Frank Sr.]: I know coming here was an 
inconvenience for you, but I want you to know how 
appreciative I am that you came. Can you tell me 
what it’s like for you to be here? [Forming a relation-
ship through joining]
Frank Sr.: Well, I have to tell you that I don’t like it 
much. [Pause] Things are a lot different today than 
they used to be. We didn’t have counseling 20 years 
ago. I had a problem with drinking at one point, 
but I got over it. I just quit—on my own. That’s 
what Stan needs to do. He just needs to stop.
Therapist: So I’m hearing that life is better for you 
without alcohol, and you would like Stan’s life to 
be better too. [Reframing]
Frank Sr.: Yeah. I’d like his life to be better in a lot of 
different ways.

Therapist: Angie, what about you? What is it like 
for you to be here? [Forming a relationship with each 
member]
Angie: It’s heartbreaking. It’s always heartbreaking. 
He [Referring to Frank Sr.] makes it sound as if he 
just summoned up his own personal power and 
quit drinking through his own strength of charac-
ter. That’s a laugh. I threatened to leave him. That’s 
what really happened. I was ready to get a divorce! 
And we’re Catholics. We don’t get divorced. [Possible 
face-to-face sequence around family stress and coping]
Therapist: So you’ve been through this before.
Angie:
 Oh my, yes. My father and mother drank. Dad 
still does. My sister won’t admit it, but she drinks 
too much. She goes crazy with it. Judy’s husband 
has a problem. I’m surrounded by alcoholics. I get 
so angry. I wish they would all just die or go away. 
[Possible transgenerational family sequence: an entry 
point for exploring values, beliefs, and rules]
Therapist:
 So this is something the whole family has 
been dealing with for a long time.
Angie: Not everyone. I don’t drink. Frankie and  
Judy don’t drink. And Karl doesn’t seem to have  
a problem.
Therapist: Is that how the family gets divided: into 
those who drink and those who don’t? [Possible 
organization perspective]
Judy: Drinking isn’t the only problem we have. It’s 
probably not even the most important.
Therapist: Say more about that.
Judy:
 Stan has always had it hard. I feel sorry for him. 
Frankie is clearly Dad’s favorite [Frank Sr. protests, 
saying he doesn’t have favorites], and things have al-
ways come easily for me. And Karl, he gets whatever 
he wants. He’s Mom’s favorite. Mom and Dad have 
fought a lot over the years. None of us have been 
that happy, but Stan seems to have the worst of it. 
[Again, possible sequence and organization perspectives]
Frank Jr.:
 As I remember it, Stan gave Dad and Mom a 
lot to fight about. He was always messing up in one 
way or another.
Therapist:
 Frankie, when your father was talking 
earlier, I sensed he had some disappointment about 
Stan too, but he also wanted to see things work out 
better for him. Is that true for you too? [Reframing 
Frankie’s comment, maintaining a focus on new possibili-
ties and new relations that might be developed]
Frank Jr.: Yes. I would like his life to be better.
The initial part of this counseling session has been 
devoted to meeting family members, listening intently 
to the multiple perspectives they present, and refram-
ing  Stan’s  problem  into  a  family  desire  for  a  positive  
outcome. Although there is a long way to go, the seeds 
of change have already been planted. There is evidence 
in  these  early  interactions  that  Stan’s  problem  has  a  
multigenerational context. If this context is explored, 
family  sequences  that  support  and  maintain  alcohol  
as a problem may be identified. It is possible to track 
these  interactions  and  to  work  toward  more  congru-
ent  communications.  Evolving  relational,  organiza-
tional,  developmental  sequences  might  be  explored  
as  a  means  of  freeing  family  members  for  new  possi-
bilities in their life together. Among other possibilities 
still  to  be  explored  are  perspectives  related  to  gender  
and culture. If the therapist were just listening to Stan, 
only one point of view would be evident. In this family 
session,  multiple  perspectives  and  the  entire  interac-
tive process become clear in a very short time.
As the family interview proceeds, a number of pos-
sibilities are presented for consideration. The therapist 
considers and may structure therapy around any or all 
of the following possibilities:
1.
 Stan’s parents have not been a well-functioning 
leadership team for a long time, and both their 
spousal relationship and their parenting have 
suffered.
2. The adult siblings need a new opportunity to func-
tion together without the influence and distrac-
tions continually imposed by the parents.
3. Stan has been reduced to a single part (his alco-
holic part), and his description and experience of 
himself needs to be enlarged—both for his own 
perspective and in the eyes of others.
A  new  place  for  Stan  in  the  family,  a  better  way  
of relating, and an ability to access “lost” parts of his 
internal  system  are  all  critical  to  winning  his  battle  
with  alcohol.  As  therapy  continues,  it  becomes  clear  
that two separate relational–organization hypotheses 
must  be  explored.  One  is  that  the  spousal  relation-

ship has been defined by the problem of alcohol too, 
and  it  has  not  evolved  or  developed  in  any  kind  of  
positive  way  over  the  years.  Second,  the  transgen-
erational sequences have targeted Stan and assigned 
him to a fixed role that he has been expected to play 
that has blocked development past his middle to late 
adolescence, which was the period in which he start-
ed drinking.
Questions for Reflection
What unique values do you see in working 
with Stan from a multilayered, systemic per-
spective as opposed to an individual therapy 
approach?
What internal parts might Stan re-access as he 
continues in therapy? What parts of him might be 
polarized?
Assuming that Stan was successful in getting 
at least some of his family members to another 
session, where would you begin? Would you get 
everyone involved in the sessions? If so, how would 
you do that?
What are some specific ways to explore other per-
spectives with this family?
What hypotheses are you developing, and how 
would you share them with the family?
Are there systemic interventions that you would 
find hopeful in terms of facilitating change?
A
s a family therapist, I look at Gwen as the index 
person in the context of her family system. Gwen 
has  a  strong  extended  family  system  and  kinship  ties  
that  go  beyond  blood  relatives  to  close  friends  who  
are  called  aunts,  uncles,  and  cousins.  When  Gwen  
begins  to  experience  episodes  of  depression  and  feels  
overwhelmed,  the  entire  family  is  affected.  African  
American families often become enmeshed due to our 
collectivistic nature. The cultural theme most often ex-
pressed is that “when something happens to one of us, 
it  happens  to  all  of  us.”  It  has  been  challenging  to  get  
Gwen’s  entire  family  in  for  a  session,  but  she  has  man-
aged it. The extended family is a great strength in the Af-
rican American community, and Gwen’s family has pro-
vided her with a great deal of love and support. I want to 
validate  these  efforts  and  let  the  family  know  that  they  
are already doing many things to support Gwen.
I  invite  everyone  in,  greeting  each  one  individu-
ally. My first step with the family is to join with them 
by finding out how they feel about being in session.
Ron:  [Gwen’s husband] I rushed from work to be here, 
because, well, I want Gwen to feel better. I have 
to say I was not so sure about this when she first 
brought it up. I am not used to talking to strangers 
about my business, but I trust Gwen. I want what is 
best for her.
Therapist: Thanks Ron, I appreciate you being here. 
I know that you all have busy lives. But what is it 
that you want for yourself from these sessions?
Ron: Well, Gwen, she is an amazing woman, but ... 
when she has these episodes of depression, I feel 
helpless and nervous. I want to figure this thing 
out and get past it. I want my wife to feel better, 
and I want to help her however I can.
Therapist: I get the feeling that you would move 
heaven and earth to help your wife be happier than 
she is right now.
Ron: Yes, I certainly would.
Therapist: I appreciate that. And Lisa, what about 
you?
Lisa:  [the youngest daughter, age 26] I want Mom to feel 
better, she is such a powerhouse. She helps every-
one else, and then she crashes. I am a little nervous 
to be here. I don’t want to find out that she is going 
through this because of something I did. She helps 
me out with my bills, and I know I could do more 
for her. I never help her with grandma, and I know 
that is just more work for her.
Therapist: Lisa, I am sure that is important for your 
mother to hear. But before I ask her to respond, I 
would like to hear from other family members.

Brittany:  [the eldest daughter, age 29] I have been really 
busy trying to get my career established. Mom has 
been helping me, and I really had no idea she was 
feeling overwhelmed and depressed. I am not sure 
I really understand what is happening. I love my 
mom, and I want to be here for her. She has always 
had these ups and downs. Is this any different? I 
love my mom, but she is so busy that I have given 
up on trying to keep up with her. So when I hear 
she wants to have a session, I am confused. Dad is 
so good with her. He keeps everything rolling when 
she is feeling down.
Therapist: I hear both your confusion and your 
willingness to be here for your mom. Gwen, what is 
this like for you?
Gwen:
 I am so thankful that I have such a loving 
family that is willing to come talk to a complete 
stranger so that I can get the help I need. Right 
now I am feeling overwhelmed with life, and I am 
tired of it. I am juggling so many things and feel 
like nothing is getting done. I know this has been 
going on for long time, but I am ready to find a bet-
ter way of living. I know this pattern has not been 
easy for any of you, and I feel guilty over that too. I 
don’t want to hide in bed anymore, like I remember 
my mom doing. I am not getting any younger, and 
I am so ready to show up in life in a healthier way.
Therapist: What would that look like?
Gwen: Well, I don’t know for sure. I would be happy, 
I guess. I would not be worried about work or the 
family so much.
Therapist: And what would your family be doing if 
you were happier and healthier?
Gwen: I guess they would be happier too. It seems like 
if I am happy, then they are too.
Therapist: But how can you be happy and healthy 
with all these burdens hanging on you?
Gwen: I am hoping you can tell me.
Therapist: Would it be OK with you if I gave that  
a try?
Gwen: Yes, please.
Therapist:
 Here is what I think is almost always true. 
A super responsible person is always surrounded 
by people who will let her take charge and handle 
everything.
Gwen: What do you mean by that?
Therapist: It means, Gwen, that you have been in 
charge for a very long time, and you have forgotten 
how to ask for help. Maybe you never knew how to 
do that. But as long as you keep pushing forward, 
your family will let you.
Gwen’s Mother: That’s right there!
Ron: Wait a minute. I do everything I can to keep 
things moving! What else do you need?
Gwen: I don’t know. I am just hearing that I need 
help.
Therapist:
 So that’s the issue for this family. Mom 
is the only one that knows everything that needs 
to happen. She knows how to do everything, but 
she is overloaded. She doesn’t know how to ask 
for help, and everyone else is hoping she won’t 
because everyone is busy and overloaded. And, 
Gwen, even if you did ask for help from others, 
would you worry whether they were doing it 
right?
Brittany: Are you kidding? She would be supervising 
everything anyway.
Therapist: And how many of you would know how 
to mess it up just enough so that mom would take 
over again? [pause while family members look at each 
other; some smile a bit; some hang their heads] Wow. 
That brought everything to a standstill. Where do 
we go from here?
Ron: Maybe we need to go home and think about 
this. We definitely need to do something differ-
ently. I want to talk to your brother and let him 
know how much pressure your mom is under so 
he can start taking care of his own business. We 
better start by making a list of everything Gwen 
has been doing and see where we need to step up. 
[pause] And maybe Gwen needs to stay out of  
this part.
Therapist:
 Let’s see where that goes.
We  set  a  time  for  future  sessions,  and  I  let  them  
know  that  coming  in  for  therapy  shows  their  com-
mitment to Gwen and to each other as a family unit. I 
want them to know that I understand what it took for 
them to make it in the door and that their efforts are 
commendable.

Summary and Evaluation
Summary
Let’s first review the themes that unite the many approaches to family ther-
apy, with particular emphasis on the multilayered approach.
Basic  Assumption  If  we  hope  to  work  therapeutically  with  an  individual,  it  is  
critical to consider him or her within the family system. An individual’s problematic 
behavior  grows  out  of  the  interactional  unit  of  the  family  as  well  as  the  larger  
community and societal systems.
Focus of Family Therapy Most of the family therapies tend to be brief because 
families who seek professional help typically want resolution of some problematic 
symptom. Changing the system can stimulate change quickly. In addition to being 
short-term,  solution-focused,  and  action-oriented,  family  therapy  tends  to  deal  
with  present  interactions.  The  main  focus  of  family  therapy  is  on  here-and-now  
interactions  in  the  family  system.  One  way  in  which  family  therapy  differs  from  
many  individual  therapies  is  its  emphasis  on  how  current  family  relationships  
contribute to the development and maintenance of symptoms.
Role  of  Goals  and  Values  Specific  goals  are  determined  by  the  practitioner’s  
orientation or by a collaborative process between family and therapist. Global goals 
include  using  interventions  that  enable  individuals  and  the  family  to  change  in  
ways that will reduce their distress. Tied to the question of what goals should guide 
a therapist’s interventions is the question of the therapist’s values. Family therapy 
is  grounded  on  a  set  of  values  and  theoretical  assumptions.  Ultimately,  every  
intervention a therapist makes is an expression of a value judgment. It is critical for 
therapists, regardless of their theoretical orientation, to be aware of their values and 
monitor how these values influence their practice with families.
How Families Change An integrative approach to the practice of family therapy 
includes  guiding  principles  that  help  the  therapist  organize  goals,  interactions,  
observations,  and  ways  to  promote  change.  Some  perspectives  of  family  systems  
therapy   focus   on   perceptual   and   cognitive   change,   others   deal   mainly   with   
changing feelings, and still other theories emphasize behavioral change. Regardless

Questions for Reflection

vened to get family members connected in their 
first family therapy session?
What do you imagine it would be like for you to 
be a participant in this family therapy session with 
this therapist?
What value do you see for Gwen in having a fam-

therapy sessions?
Beginning therapists are usually anxious about hav-
ing so many people in the room because it can be 
confusing. How did the therapist in this case man-
age the session so that it did not become chaotic?

of the perspectives that a family therapist operates from, change needs to happen in 
relationships, not just within the individual.
Techniques of Family Therapy The intervention strategies therapists employ are 
best  considered  in  conjunction  with  their  personal  characteristics.  Bitter  (2014),  
Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2013), and Nichols (2013) emphasize that techniques 
are  tools  for  achieving  therapeutic  goals  but  that  these  intervention  strategies  do  
not  make  a  family  therapist.  Personal  characteristics  such  as  respect  for  clients,  
compassion,  empathy,  and  sensitivity  are  human  qualities  that  influence  the  
manner  in  which  techniques  are  delivered.  It  is  also  essential  to  have  a  rationale  
for the techniques that are used, with some sense of the expected outcomes. Faced 
with meeting the demands of clinical practice, practitioners will need to be flexible 
in selecting intervention strategies. The central consideration is what is in the best 
interests of the family.
A multilayered approach to family therapy is more complex than models with 
a  singular  focus.  At  least  initially,  some  of  the  confidence  and  clarity  that  might  
be gained from a single approach may be lost, but in time the flexibility to change 
directions is an asset. We have presented a structure for therapy that is useful across 
models. We have integrated a multilayered process of family therapy in assessment, 
hypothesizing,  and  facilitating  change.  This  chapter  has  described  a  collabora-
tive process for therapy in which both the family and the therapist share influence 
according to the needs of the situation.
Contributions of Family Systems Approaches
One of the key contributions of most systemic approaches is that neither the indi-
vidual nor the family is blamed for a particular dysfunction. The family is empow-
ered  through  the  process  of  identifying  and  exploring  internal,  developmental,  
and purposeful interactional patterns. At the same time, a systems perspective rec-
ognizes  that  individuals  and  families  are  affected  by  external  forces  and  systems,  
among them illness, shifting gender patterns, culture, and socioeconomic consider-
ations. If change is to occur in families or with individuals, therapists must be aware 
of as many systems of influence as possible.
Most  of  the  individual  therapies  considered  in  this  textbook  fail  to  give  a  pri-
mary focus to the systemic factors influencing the individual. Family therapy rede-
fines the individual as a system embedded within many other systems, which brings 
an entirely different perspective to assessment and treatment. An advantage to this 
viewpoint is that an individual is not scapegoated as the “bad person” in the family. 
Rather than blaming either the “identified patient” or a family, the entire family has 
an opportunity (a) to examine the multiple perspectives and interactional patterns 
that characterize the unit and (b) to participate in finding solutions.
Limitations and Criticisms of Family Systems Approaches
In the early days of family therapy, therapists all too often got lost in their consid-
eration  of  the  “system.”  In  adopting  the  language  of  systems,  therapists  began  to  
describe and think of families as being made up of “dyads” and “triads”; as being “func-
tional” or “dysfunctional,” “stuck” or “unstuck,” and “enmeshed” or “disengaged”;

and  as  displaying  “positive”  and  “negative”  outcomes  and  “feedback  loops.”  It  was  
as  if  the  family  was  a  well-oiled  machine  or  perhaps  a  computer  that  occasionally  
broke down. Just as it was easy to fix a machine without an emotional consideration 
of  the  parts  involved,  some  therapists  approached  family  systems  work  with  little  
concern for the individuals as long as the “whole” of the family “functioned” better. 
Enactments,  ordeals,  and  paradoxical  interventions  were  often  “done  to”  clients—
sometimes even without their knowledge (see Haley, 1963, 1976, 1984; Minuchin & 
Fishman, 1981; Selvini Palazzolli, Boscolo, Cecchin, & Prata, 1978).
Feminists were perhaps the first, but not the only, group to lament the loss of 
a personal perspective within a systemic framework. As the field moves now toward 
an integration of individual and systemic frameworks, it is important to reinvest the 
language of therapy with human emotional terminology that honors the place real 
people have always held in families. It is our hope that this chapter gives you enough 
of an introduction to the diverse field of family therapy that you will want to learn 
more through reading as well as watching the many video currently available.

Introduction
This chapter will help you think about areas of convergence and divergence among 
the 11 therapeutic systems covered in this book. Although these approaches all have 
some goals in common, they have many differences when it comes to the best route 
to achieve these goals. Some therapies call for an active and directive stance on the 
therapist’s part, and others place value on clients being the active agent. Some ther-
apies  focus  on  experiencing  feelings,  others  stress  identifying  cognitive  patterns,  and  
still others concentrate on actual behavior. The key task is to find ways to integrate 
certain features of each of these approaches so that you can work with clients on all 
three levels of human experience.
The  field  of  psychotherapy  is  characterized  by  a  diverse  range  of  specialized  
models.  With  all  this  diversity,  is  there  any  hope  that  a  practitioner  can  develop  
skills  in  all  of  the  existing  techniques?  How  does  a  student  decide  which  theories  
are  most  relevant  to  practice?  Looking  for  commonalities  among  the  systems  of  
psychotherapy is relatively new (Norcross & Beutler, 2014). Practitioners have been 
battling  over  the  “best”  way  to  bring  about  personality  change  dating  back  to  the  
work  of  Freud.  For  decades,  counselors  resisted  integration,  often  to  the  point  of  
denying the validity of alternative theories and of ignoring effective methods from 
other theoretical schools. The early history of counseling is full of theoretical wars.
Since  the  early  1980s,  psychotherapy  integration  has  developed  into  a  clearly  
delineated field. It is now an established and respected movement that is based on 
combining the best of differing orientations so that more complete theoretical mod-
els can be articulated and more efficient treatments developed (Goldfried, Pachan-
kis,  &  Bell,  2005).  The  Society  for  the  Exploration  of  Psychotherapy  Integration,  
formed in 1983, is an international organization whose members are professionals 
working  toward  the  development  of  therapeutic  approaches  that  transcend  single  
theoretical orientations. As the field of psychotherapy has matured, the concept of 
integration has emerged as a mainstay (Norcross & Beutler, 2014).
In this chapter I consider the advantages of developing an integrative perspec-
tive for counseling practice. I also present a framework to help you begin to integrate 
concepts and techniques from various approaches. As you read, start to formulate 
your  own  personal  perspective  for  counseling.  Look  for  ways  to  synthesize  diverse  
elements  from  different  theoretical  perspectives.  As  much  as  possible,  be  alert  to  
how these systems can function in harmony.
 Visit CengageBrain.com or watch the DVD for the video program on Chapter 15, Theory and 
Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy: The Case of Stan and Lecturettes. I suggest that you view the 
brief lecture for each chapter prior to reading the chapter.
The Movement Toward Psychotherapy Integration
A  large  number  of  therapists  identify  themselves  as  “eclectic,”  and  this  category  
covers  a  broad  range  of  practice.  At  its  worst,  eclectic  practice  consists  of  haphaz-
ardly  picking  techniques  without  any  overall  theoretical  rationale.  This  is  known  
as syncretism, wherein the practitioner, lacking in knowledge and skill in selecting 
interventions, looks for anything that seems to work, often making little attempt to

determine whether the therapeutic procedures are indeed effective. Such an uncriti-
cal  and  unsystematic  combination  of  techniques  is  no  better  than  a  narrow  and  
dogmatic orthodoxy. Pulling techniques from many sources without a sound ratio-
nale results in syncretistic confusion, which is detrimental to the successful treat-
ment of clients (Corey, 2015; Neukrug, 2016; Norcross & Beutler, 2014).
Pathways Toward Psychotherapy Integration
Psychotherapy integration is best characterized by attempts to look beyond 
and across the confines of single-school approaches to see what can be learned from 
other  perspectives  and  how  clients  can  benefit  from  a  variety  of  ways  of  conduct-
ing therapy. The majority of psychotherapists do not claim allegiance to a particular 
therapeutic  school  but  prefer,  instead,  some  form  of  integration  (Norcross,  2005;  
Norcross  &  Beutler,  2014).  In  a  2007  survey,  only  4.2%  of  respondents  identified  
themselves as being aligned with one therapy model exclusively. The remaining 95.8% 
claimed to be integrative, meaning they combined a variety of methods or approaches 
in their counseling practice (Psychotherapy Networker, 2007). A panel of psychotherapy 
experts has predicted an increase in the popularity of integrative therapies in the next 
decade, particularly with regard to mindfulness, cognitive behavioral, multicultural, 
and integrative theories (Norcross, Pfund, & Prochaska, 2013).
The integrative approach is characterized by openness to various ways of inte-
grating  diverse  theories  and  techniques,  and  there  is  a  decided  preference  for  the  
term integrative over eclectic (Norcross, Karpiak, & Lister, 2005). The ultimate goal of 
integration is to enhance the efficiency and applicability of psychotherapy. Norcross 
and  Beutler  (2014)  and  Stricker  (2010)  describe  four  of  the  most  common  path-
ways  toward  the  integration  of  psychotherapies:  technical  integration,  theoretical  
integration,  assimilative  integration,  and  common  factors  approach.  All  of  these  
approaches  to  integration  look  beyond  the  restrictions  of  single  approaches,  but  
they do so in distinctive ways.
technical integration aims at selecting the best treatment techniques for the 
individual  and  the  problem.  It  tends  to  focus  on  differences,  chooses  from  many  
approaches, and is a collection of techniques. This path calls for using techniques 
from different schools without necessarily subscribing to the theoretical positions 
that spawned them. For those who practice from the perspective of technical inte-
gration, there is no necessary connection between conceptual foundations and tech-
niques.  Therapists  have  a  variety  of  tools  in  their  toolkit  to  use  with  clients.  One  
of  the  best-known  forms  of  technical  integration,  which  Lazarus  (2008a)  refers  to  
as technical  eclecticism,  is  the  basis  of  multimodal  therapy.  Multimodal  therapists  bor-
row from many other therapeutic models, using techniques that have been demon-
strated to be effective in dealing with specific clinical problems. Whenever feasible, 
multimodal therapists employ empirically supported techniques.
In  contrast,  theoretical  integration  refers  to  a  conceptual  or  theoretical  cre-
ation beyond a mere blending of techniques. This route has the goal of producing a 
conceptual framework that synthesizes the best aspects of two or more theoretical 
approaches under the assumption that the outcome will be richer than either the-
ory alone. This approach emphasizes integrating the underlying theories of therapy 
along with techniques from each. Examples of this form of integration are dialectical

critical component of effective therapy. Research confirms that the client–therapist 
relationship is central to therapeutic change and is a significant predictor of both 
effectiveness and retention of therapy outcomes (Elkins, 2016; Miller, Hubble, & 
Seidel, 2015).
Advantages of Psychotherapy Integration
An  integrative  approach  provides  a  general  framework  that  enables  practi-
tioners  to  make  sense  of  the  many  aspects  of  the  therapy  process  and  provides  a  
map giving direction to what practitioners do and say (Corey, 2015). One reason for 
the movement toward psychotherapy integration is the recognition that no single 
theory is comprehensive enough to account for the complexities of human behav-
ior, especially when the range of client types and their specific problems are taken 
into  consideration.  Because  no  one  theory  contains  all  the  truth,  and  because  no  
single set of counseling techniques is always effective in working with diverse client 
populations, integrative approaches hold promise for counseling practice. Norcross 
and  Wampold  (2011b)  maintain  that  effective  clinical  practice  requires  a  flexible  
and integrative perspective. Psychotherapy should be flexibly tailored to the unique 
needs  and  contexts  of  the  individual  client.  Norcross  and  Wampold  contend  that  
using an identical therapy relationship style and treatment method for all clients is 
inappropriate and can be unethical.
The  11  systems  discussed  in  this  book  have  evolved  in  the  direction  of  broad-
ening their theoretical and practical bases and have become less restrictive in their 
focus.  Many  practitioners  who  claim  allegiance  to  a  particular  system  of  therapy  
are expanding their theoretical outlook and developing a wider range of therapeu-
tic techniques to fit a more diverse population of clients. There is a growing recog-
nition  that  psychotherapy  can  be  most  effective  when  contributions  from  various  
approaches  are  integrated  (Goldfried,  Glass,  &  Arnkoff,  2011).  Although  to  date  
the  bulk  of  psychotherapy  integration  has  been  based  on  theoretical  and  clinical  
foundations,  Goldfried  and  colleagues  suggest  that  evidence-based  practice  will  
increasingly  become  the  organizing  force  for  integration.  Empirical  pragmatism,  
not theory, will be the integrative theme of the 21st century.
Practitioners  who  are  open  to  an  integrative  perspective  will  find  that  several  
theories play a crucial role in their personal counseling approach. Each theory has 
its  unique  contributions  and  its  own  domain  of  expertise.  By  accepting  that  each  
theory has strengths and weaknesses and is, by definition, “different” from the oth-
ers,  practitioners  have  some  basis  to  begin  developing  a  theory  that  fits  for  them  
and their clients. It takes considerable time to learn the various theories in depth. It 
is not realistic for any of us to expect that we can integrate all the theories. Instead, 
integration of some aspects of some theories is a more realistic goal. Developing an 
integrative perspective is a lifelong endeavor that is refined with clinical experience, 
reflection, reading, and discourse with colleagues.
The Challenge of Developing an Integrative Perspective
A  survey  of  approaches  to  counseling  and  psychotherapy  reveals  that  no  
common  philosophy  unifies  them.  Many  of  the  theories  have  different  basic  phi-
losophies  and  views  of  human  nature  (Table  15.1).  As  the  postmodern  therapists

TabLe 15.1 The basic Philosophies
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Human beings are basically determined by psychic energy and by early experiences. Unconscious 
motives and conflicts are central in present behavior. Early development is of critical importance 
because later personality problems have their roots in repressed childhood conflicts.
Adlerian  
therapy
Humans are motivated by social interest, by striving toward goals, by inferiority and superiority, and 
by dealing with the tasks of life. Emphasis is on the individual’s positive capacities to live in society 
cooperatively. People have the capacity to interpret, influence, and create events. Each person at an 
early age creates a unique style of life, which tends to remain relatively constant throughout life.
Existential  
therapy
The central focus is on the nature of the human condition, which includes a capacity for self-
awareness, freedom of choice to decide one’s fate, responsibility, anxiety, the search for meaning, 
being alone and being in relation with others, striving for authenticity, and facing living and dying.
Person-centered 
therapy
Positive view of people; we have an inclination toward becoming fully functioning. In the context of 
the therapeutic relationship, the client experiences feelings that were previously denied to awareness. 
The client moves toward increased awareness, spontaneity, trust in self, and inner-directedness.
Gestalt therapyThe person strives for wholeness and integration of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Some key 
concepts include contact with self and others, contact boundaries, and awareness. The view is 
nondeterministic in that the person is viewed as having the capacity to recognize how earlier 
influences are related to present difficulties. As an experiential approach, it is grounded in the here 
and now and emphasizes awareness, personal choice, and responsibility.
Behavior  
therapy
Behavior is the product of learning. We are both the product and the producer of the environment. 
Traditional behavior therapy is based on classical and operant principles. Contemporary behavior 
therapy has branched out in many directions, including mindfulness and acceptance approaches.
Cognitive  
behavior therapy
Individuals tend to incorporate faulty thinking, which leads to emotional and behavioral disturbances. 
Cognitions are the major determinants of how we feel and act. Therapy is primarily oriented toward cognition 
and behavior, and it stresses the role of thinking, deciding, questioning, doing, and redeciding. This is a 
psychoeducational model, which emphasizes therapy as a learning process, including acquiring and practicing 
new skills, learning new ways of thinking, and acquiring more effective ways of coping with problems.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
Based on choice theory, this approach assumes that we need quality relationships to be happy. 
Psychological problems are the result of our resisting control by others or of our attempt to control 
others. Choice theory is an explanation of human nature and how to best achieve satisfying 
interpersonal relationships.
Feminist  
therapy
Feminists criticize many traditional theories to the degree that they are based on gender-biased 
concepts, such as being androcentric, gendercentric, ethnocentric, heterosexist, and intrapsychic. The 
constructs of feminist therapy include being gender fair, flexible, interactionist, and life-span-oriented. 
Gender and power are at the heart of feminist therapy. This is a systems approach that recognizes the 
cultural, social, and political factors that contribute to an individual’s problems.
Postmodern 
approaches
Based on the premise that there are multiple realities and multiple truths, postmodern therapies 
reject the idea that reality is external and can be grasped. People create meaning in their lives 
through conversations with others. The postmodern approaches avoid pathologizing clients, take 
a dim view of diagnosis, avoid searching for underlying causes of problems, and place a high value 
on discovering clients’ strengths and resources. Rather than talking about problems, the focus of 
therapy is on creating solutions in the present and the future.
Family systems 
therapy
The family is viewed from an interactive and systemic perspective. Clients are connected to a living 
system; a change in one part of the system will result in a change in other parts. The family provides 
the context for understanding how individuals function in relationship to others and how they 
behave. Treatment deals with the family unit. An individual’s dysfunctional behavior grows out of 
the interactional unit of the family and out of larger systems as well.

remind  us,  our  philosophical  assumptions  are  important  because  they  influence  
which “reality” we perceive, and they direct our attention to the variables that we are 
“set” to see. A word of caution, then: Beware of subscribing exclusively to any one 
view  of  human  nature.  Remain  open  and  selectively  incorporate  a  framework  for  
counseling that is consistent with your own personality and belief system and that 
validates clients’ belief systems as well.
Despite the divergences in the various theories, creative syntheses among some 
models are possible. For example, an existential orientation does not necessarily pre-
clude using techniques drawn from behavior therapy or from some of the cognitive 
theories.  Each  point  of  view  offers  a  perspective  for  helping  clients  in  their  search  
for self. I encourage you to study all the major theories and to remain open to what 
you might take from the various orientations as a basis for an integrative perspective 
that will guide your practice.
In developing a personal integrative perspective, it is important to be alert to the 
problem of attempting to mix theories with incompatible underlying assumptions. 
Examine the key concepts of various theories as you begin to think about integra-
tion (Table 15.2). By remaining theoretically consistent, but technically integrative, 
practitioners can spell out precisely the interventions they will employ with various 
clients, as well as the means by which they will select these procedures.
TabLe 15.2 Key Concepts
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Normal personality development is based on successful resolution and integration of psychosexual 
stages of development. Faulty personality development is the result of inadequate resolution of 
some specific stage. Anxiety is a result of repression of basic conflicts. Unconscious processes are 
centrally related to current behavior.
Adlerian  
therapy
Key concepts include the unity of personality, the need to view people from their subjective 
perspective, and the importance of life goals that give direction to behavior. People are motivated 
by social interest and by finding goals to give life meaning. Other key concepts are striving 
for significance and superiority, developing a unique lifestyle, and understanding the family 
constellation. Therapy is a matter of providing encouragement and assisting clients in changing their 
cognitive perspective and behavior.
Existential  
therapy
Essentially an experiential approach to counseling rather than a firm theoretical model, it stresses 
core human conditions. Interest is on the present and on what one is becoming. The approach has 
a future orientation and stresses self-awareness before action.
Person-centered  
therapy
The client has the potential to become aware of problems and the means to resolve them. Faith is 
placed in the client’s capacity for self-direction. Mental health is a congruence of ideal self and real 
self. Maladjustment is the result of a discrepancy between what one wants to be and what one is. 
In therapy attention is given to the present moment and on experiencing and expressing feelings.
Gestalt  
therapy
Emphasis is on the “what” and “how” of experiencing in the here and now to help clients accept all 
aspects of themselves. Key concepts include holism, figure-formation process, awareness, unfinished 
business and avoidance, contact, and energy.
Behavior  
therapy
Focus is on overt behavior, precision in specifying goals of treatment, development of specific 
treatment plans, and objective evaluation of therapy outcomes. Present behavior is given attention. 
Therapy is based on the principles of learning theory. Normal behavior is learned through 
reinforcement and imitation. Abnormal behavior is the result of faulty learning.

434            CHAPTER FIFTEEN
One of the challenges you will face as a counselor is to deliver therapeutic ser-
vices  in  a  brief,  comprehensive,  effective,  and  flexible  way.  Many  of  the  theoretical  
orientations addressed in this book can be applied to brief forms of therapy. One of 
the driving forces of the psychotherapy integration movement has been the increase 
of  brief  therapies  and  the  pressures  to  do  more  for  a  variety  of  client  populations  
within the limitations of 6 to 20 sessions. Short-term and very-short-term therapies 
are increasing (Norcross et al., 2013). Time-limited brief therapy refers to a variety 
of time-sensitive, goal-directed, efficiency-oriented methods. These methods can be 
incorporated in any theoretical approach (Hoyt, 2015). Lambert (2011) believes the 
future  direction  of  theory,  practice,  and  training  will  see  (1)  the  decline  of  single-
theory practice and the growth of integrative therapies, and (2) the increase in short-
term, time-limited, and group treatments that seem to be as effective as long-term 
individual treatments with many client populations.
An  integrative  perspective  at  its  best  entails  a  systematic  integration  of  underly-
ing  principles  and  methods  common  to  a  range  of  therapeutic  approaches.  The  
strengths of systematic integration are based on its ability to be taught, replicated, 
and evaluated (Norcross & Beutler, 2014). To develop this kind of integration, you 
will eventually need to be thoroughly conversant with a number of theories, be open 
to  the  idea  that  these  theories  can  be  connected  in  some  ways,  and  be  willing  to  
continually test your hypotheses to determine how well they are working. Neukrug 
(2016) reminds us that “the ability to assimilate techniques from varying theoretical 
perspectives takes knowledge, time, and finesse” (p. 139).
Cognitive behavior 
therapy
Although psychological problems may be rooted in childhood, they are reinforced by present 
ways of thinking. A person’s belief system and thinking is the primary cause of disorders. Internal 
dialogue plays a central role in one’s behavior. Clients focus on examining faulty assumptions and 
misconceptions and on replacing these with effective beliefs.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
The basic focus is on what clients are doing and how to get them to evaluate whether their present 
actions are working for them. People are mainly motivated to satisfy their needs, especially the need 
for significant relationships. The approach rejects the medical model, the notion of transference, the 
unconscious, and dwelling on one’s past.
Feminist  
therapy
Core principles of feminist therapy are that the personal is political, therapists have a commitment 
to social change, women’s voices and ways of knowing are valued and women’s experiences are 
honored, the counseling relationship is egalitarian, therapy focuses on strengths and a reformulated 
definition of psychological distress, and all types of oppression are recognized.
Postmodern  
approaches
Therapy tends to be brief and addresses the present and the future. The person is not the problem; 
the problem is the problem. The emphasis is on externalizing the problem and looking for 
exceptions to the problem. Therapy consists of a collaborative dialogue in which the therapist and 
the client co-create solutions. By identifying instances when the problem did not exist, clients can 
create new meanings for themselves and fashion a new life story.
Family systems 
therapy
Focus is on communication patterns within a family, both verbal and nonverbal. Problems in 
relationships are likely to be passed on from generation to generation. Key concepts vary depending 
on specific orientation but include differentiation, triangles, power coalitions, family-of-origin 
dynamics, functional versus dysfunctional interaction patterns, and dealing with here-and-now 
interactions. The present is more important than exploring past experiences.

therapeutic relationships (Frame, 2003; Johnson, 2013; Young & Cashwell, 2011a). 
Survey  data  from  members  of  both  the  American  Psychological  Association  and  
the American Counseling Association indicate that spiritual and religious matters 
are therapeutically relevant, ethically appropriate, and potentially significant topics 
for the practice of counseling in secular settings (Delaney, Miller, & Bisono, 2007; 
Young, Wiggins-Frame, & Cashwell, 2007).
Worthington  (2011)  asserts  that  the  increasing  openness  of  therapists  to  cli-
ents’ spiritual and religious concerns and interests has been fueled by the multicul-
tural evolution. The emphasis on multiculturalism has empowered people to define 
themselves from a cultural perspective, which includes their spiritual, religious, and 
ethnic contexts. Johnson (2013) views spiritually informed therapy as a form of mul-
ticultural therapy. The first step is for the therapist to be sincerely interested in the 
client’s  spiritual  beliefs  and  experiences  and  how  he  or  she  finds  meaning  in  life.  
Johnson believes that a client-defined sense of spirituality can be a significant avenue 
for connecting with the client and can be an ally in the therapeutic change process. 
However, the emphasis is on what the client wants, not on the therapist’s spiritual 
experiences or agenda for the client.
Clients  who  are  experiencing  a  crisis  situation  may  find  a  source  of  comfort,  
support,  and  strength  in  drawing  upon  their  spiritual  resources.  For  some  clients  
spirituality entails embracing a religion, which can have many different meanings. 
Other clients value spirituality, yet do not have any ties to a formal religion. What-
ever one’s particular view of spirituality, it is a force that can help the individual to 
find a purpose (or purposes) for living. Spiritual or religious beliefs can be a major 
sustaining  power  that  supports  clients  when  all  else  fails.  Other  clients  may  be  
affected by depression and a sense of worthlessness due to guilt, anger, or sadness 
created by their unexamined acceptance of spiritual or religious dogma. Counselors 
must remain open and nonjudgmental in conversations about religion or spiritual-
ity. Furthermore, counselors cannot ignore a client’s spiritual and religious perspec-
tives if they want to practice in a culturally competent and ethical manner (Johnson, 
2013; Young & Cashwell, 2011a, 2011b). It is essential for counselors to be aware of 
and understand their spiritual or religious attitudes, beliefs, values, and experiences 
if they expect to facilitate an exploration of these issues with clients.
Common  Goals  Spiritual  values  have  a  major  part  to  play  in  human  life  and  
struggles. Exploring these values has a great deal to do with providing solutions for 
clients’  struggles.  Because  spiritual  and  therapeutic  paths  converge  in  some  ways,  
integration is possible, and dealing with a client’s spirituality will often enhance the 
therapy process. Themes that have healing influences include loving, caring, learning 
to  listen  with  compassion,  challenging  clients’  basic  life  assumptions,  accepting  
human  imperfection,  and  going  outside  of  self-oriented  interests  (social  interest).  
Both a spiritual perspective and counseling can help people ponder questions of “Who 
am I?” and “What is the meaning of my life?” Pursuing these existential questions can 
foster healing.
Implications  for  assessment  and  Treatment  Traditionally,  when  clients  come  
to a therapist with a problem, the therapist explores all the factors that contributed 
to the development of the problem. A background of involvement in religion can be

part of a client’s history, and thus it can be a part of the intake assessment and can be 
explored in counseling sessions. Frame (2003) presents many reasons for including 
spirituality  in  the  assessment  process:  understanding  clients’  worldviews  and  the  
contexts in which they live, assisting clients in grappling with questions regarding the 
purpose of their lives and what they most value, exploring religion and spirituality as 
client resources, and uncovering religious and spiritual problems. This information 
will assist the therapist in choosing appropriate interventions. Young and Cashwell 
(2011a) maintain that counselors must assess whether clients’ spiritual or religious 
beliefs may be exacerbating or helping clients’ psychological problems.
Your Role as a Counselor It is critical that counselors not be judgmental when it 
comes to their clients’ beliefs and that counselors create an inviting and safe climate 
for clients to explore their values and beliefs. There are many paths toward fulfilling 
spiritual  needs,  and  it  is  not  your  role  as  a  counselor  to  prescribe  any  particular  
pathway. By conducting a thorough assessment on a client’s background, you will 
obtain  many  clues  regarding  personal  themes  for  potential  exploration.  If  you  
remain  finely  tuned  to  clients’  stories  and  to  the  purpose  for  which  they  sought  
therapy,  clients’  concerns  about  spiritual  or  religious  values,  beliefs,  and  practices  
will  surface.  It  is  critical  that  you  listen  for  how  clients  talk  about  existential  
concerns  of  meaning,  values,  mortality,  and  being  in  the  world.  Remain  open  to  
how your clients define, experience, and access whatever helps them stay connected 
to their core values and their inner wisdom (Johnson, 2013).
If you are to effectively serve diverse client populations, it is essential that you 
pay attention to your training and competence in addressing spiritual and religious 
concerns your clients bring to therapy. Ethically, it is important to monitor yourself 
for subtle ways that you might be inclined to influence clients to embrace a spiritual 
perspective or to give up certain religious beliefs that you think are no longer func-
tional for them. It is important to keep in mind that clients, not therapists, should 
determine the specific values they want to retain, replace, or modify.
From my vantage point, the emphasis on spirituality will continue to be impor-
tant in counseling practice, which makes it imperative that you prepare yourself to 
work competently with the spiritual and religious concerns that your clients bring 
up.  For  further  reading  on  the  topic  of  integrating  spirituality  and  religion  into  
counseling, I highly recommend Integrating Spirituality and Religion into Counseling: A 
Guide to Competent Practice (Cashwell & Young, 2011) and Spirituality in Counseling and 
Psychotherapy: An Integrative Approach That Empowers Clients (Johnson, 2013).

Becoming grounded in the present moment
Managing intense emotions such as anxiety

Reauthoring the story of one’s life
This diversity can be simplified by considering the degree of generality or speci-
ficity of goals. Goals exist on a continuum from specific, concrete, and short term 
on one end, to general, global, and long term on the other. The cognitive behavioral 
approaches stress the former; the relationship-oriented therapies tend to stress the 
latter.  The  goals  at  opposite  ends  of  the  continuum  are  not  necessarily  contradic-
tory; it is a matter of how specifically they are defined.
Therapist’s Function and Role
In working toward an integrative perspective, ask yourself these questions:
How do the counselor’s functions change depending on the stage of the 
counseling process?
Does the therapist maintain a basic role, or does this role vary in accor-
dance with the characteristics of the client?
How does the counselor determine how active and directive to be?
How is structuring handled as the course of therapy progresses?
What is the optimum balance of responsibility in the client–therapist 
relationship?
What is the most effective way to monitor the therapeutic alliance?
What, when, and how much counselor self-disclosure is therapeutic?
As you saw through your study of the 11 therapeutic approaches, a central issue 
of  each  system  is  the  degree  to  which  the  therapist  exercises  control  over  clients’  
behavior  both  during  and  outside  the  session.  Cognitive  behavior  therapists  and  
reality  therapists,  for  example,  operate  within  a  present-centered,  directive,  didac-
tic,  structured,  and  psychoeducational  context.  As  a  collaborative  endeavor,  they  
frequently design homework assignments to assist clients in practicing new behav-
ior outside therapy sessions. In contrast, person-centered therapists operate with a 
much  looser  and  less  defined  structure.  Solution-focused  and  narrative  therapists  
view the client as the expert on his or her own life; they assist the client in reflection 
outside of the session that might result in self-directed change. Although they are 
active questioners, they are not prescriptive in their practice.
Structuring depends on the particular client and the specific circumstances 
he  or  she  brings  to  the  therapy  situation.  From  my  perspective,  clear  structure  
is most essential during the early phase of counseling because it encourages the 
client to talk about the problems that led to seeking therapy. In a collaborative 
way,  it  is  useful  for  both  counselor  and  client  to  make  some  initial  assessment  
that  can  provide  a  focus  for  the  therapy  process.  As  soon  as  possible,  the  client  
should be given a significant share of the responsibility for deciding on the con-
tent and agenda of the sessions. From early in the therapy process the client can 
be empowered if the counselor expects the client to become an active participant 
in the process.

Client’s Experience in Therapy
Most  clients  share  some  degree  of  suffering,  pain,  or  at  least  discontent.  There  is  
a  discrepancy  between  how  they  would  like  to  be  and  how  they  are.  Some  individu-
als initiate therapy because they hope to cure a specific symptom or set of symptoms. 
They want to get rid of migraine headaches, free themselves of chronic anxiety attacks, 
lose weight, or get relief from depression. They may have conflicting feelings and reac-
tions,  may  struggle  with  low  self-esteem,  or  may  have  limited  information  and  
skills.  Many  seek  to  resolve  conflicts  in  their  close  relationships.  I  believe  people  
are increasingly entering therapy with existential problems. Their complaints often 
relate  to  the  these  existential  issues:  a  sense  of  emptiness,  meaninglessness  in  life,  
routine ways of living, unsatisfying personal relationships, anxiety over uncertainty, 
a lack of intense feelings, and a loss of their sense of self.
The  initial  expectation  of  many  clients  is  that  results  will  come  quickly.  They  
often have great hope for major changes in their life and rely on direction from the 
therapist. As therapy progresses, clients discover that they must be active in the pro-
cess, selecting their own goals and working toward them, both in the sessions and in 
daily living. Some clients can benefit from recognizing and expressing pent-up feel-
ings, others will need to examine their beliefs and thoughts, others will most need 
to  begin  behaving  in  different  ways,  and  others  will  benefit  from  talking  with  you  
about their relationships with the significant people in their lives. Most clients will 
need to do some work in all three dimensions—feelings, thoughts, and behaviors—
because these dimensions are interrelated.
In  deciding  what  interventions  are  most  likely  to  be  helpful,  it  is  important  
to  take  into  account  the  client’s  cultural,  ethnic,  and  socioeconomic  background.  
Moreover, the focus of counseling may change as clients enter different phases in the 
counseling process. Although some clients initially feel a need to be listened to and 
allowed to express deep feelings, they can profit later from examining the thought 
patterns that are contributing to their psychological pain. A some point in therapy, 
it is essential that clients translate what they are learning about themselves into con-
crete action. The client’s given situation in the environment provides a framework 
for selecting interventions that are most appropriate.
Relationship Between Therapist and Client
Most approaches share common ground in accepting the importance of the thera-
peutic  relationship.  The  existential,  person-centered,  Gestalt,  Adlerian,  and  post-
modern  views  emphasize  the  personal  relationship  as  the  crucial  determinant  of  
treatment  outcomes.  Rational  emotive  behavior  therapy,  reality  therapy,  cognitive  
behavior  therapy,  cognitive  therapy,  and  behavior  therapy  do  not  ignore  the  rela-
tionship factor but place less emphasis on the relationship and more emphasis on 
the effective use of techniques (Table 15.4).
Counseling is a personal matter that involves a personal relationship, and evi-
dence  indicates  that  honesty,  sincerity,  acceptance,  understanding,  and  spontane-
ity are basic ingredients for successful outcomes. Therapists’ degree of caring, their 
interest  and  ability  in  helping  their  clients,  and  their  genuineness  influence  the

TabLe 15.4 The Therapeutic Relationship
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
The classical analyst remains anonymous, and clients develop projections toward him or her. The 
focus is on reducing the resistances that develop in working with transference and on establishing 
more rational control. Clients undergo long-term analysis, engage in free association to uncover 
conflicts, and gain insight by talking. The analyst makes interpretations to teach clients the 
meaning of current behavior as it relates to the past. In contemporary relational psychoanalytic 
therapy, the relationship is central and emphasis is given to here-and-now dimensions of this 
relationship.
Adlerian  
therapy
The emphasis is on joint responsibility, on mutually determining goals, on mutual trust and respect, 
and on equality. The focus is on identifying, exploring, and disclosing mistaken goals and faulty 
assumptions within the person’s lifestyle.
Existential  
therapy
The therapist’s main tasks are to accurately grasp clients’ being in the world and to establish a 
personal and authentic encounter with them. The immediacy of the client–therapist relationship 
and the authenticity of the here-and-now encounter are stressed. Both client and therapist can be 
changed by the encounter.
Person-centered  
therapy
The relationship is of primary importance. The qualities of the therapist, including genuineness, 
warmth, accurate empathy, respect, and being nonjudgmental—and communication of these 
attitudes to clients—are stressed. Clients use this genuine relationship with the therapist to help 
them transfer what they learn to other relationships.
Gestalt  
therapy
Central importance is given to the I/Thou relationship and the quality of the therapist’s presence. 
The therapist’s attitudes and behavior count more than the techniques used. The therapist does not 
interpret for clients but assists them in developing the means to make their own interpretations. 
Clients identify and work on unfinished business from the past that interferes with current 
functioning.
Behavior  
therapy
The therapist is active and directive and functions as a teacher or mentor in helping clients learn 
more effective behavior. Clients must be active in the process and experiment with new behaviors. 
Although a quality client–therapist relationship is not viewed as sufficient to bring about change, 
it is considered essential for implementing behavioral procedures.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
In REBT the therapist functions as a teacher and the client as a student. The therapist is highly 
directive and teaches clients an A-B-C model of changing their cognitions. In CT the focus is on 
a collaborative relationship. Using a Socratic dialogue, the therapist assists clients in identifying 
dysfunctional beliefs and discovering alternative rules for living. The therapist promotes corrective 
experiences that lead to learning new skills. Clients gain insight into their problems and then 
must actively practice changing self-defeating thinking and acting. In strengths-based CBT, active 
incorporation of client strengths encourages full engagement in therapy and often provides avenues 
for change that otherwise would be missed.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
A fundamental task is for the therapist to create a good relationship with the client. Therapists are 
then able to engage clients in an evaluation of all of their relationships with respect to what they 
want and how effective they are in getting this. Therapists find out what clients want, ask what they 
are choosing to do, invite them to evaluate present behavior, help them make plans for change, and 
get them to make a commitment. The therapist is a client’s advocate, as long as the client is willing 
to attempt to behave responsibly.
Feminist  
therapy
The therapeutic relationship is based on empowerment and egalitarianism. Therapists actively 
break down the hierarchy of power and reduce artificial barriers by engaging in appropriate self-
disclosure and teaching clients about the therapy process. Therapists strive to create a collaborative 
relationship in which clients can become their own expert.

relationship.  Therapists  can  become  more  effective  by  developing  their  personal  
qualities and their interpersonal abilities. Psychotherapy is primarily a human and 
relational  endeavor  that  depends  on  the  quality  of  the  interpersonal  connection  
between participants (Duncan, 2014; Elkins, 2016). Both client and therapist bring 
origins,  culture,  expectations,  biases,  defenses,  and  strengths  to  this  relationship.  
How we create and nurture this powerful human relationship can be guided by the 
fruits of research (Norcross & Wampold, 2011a).
As you think about developing your personal counseling perspective, give con-
sideration  to  the  issue  of  the  match  between  client  and  counselor.  I  certainly  do  
not  advocate  changing  your  personality  to  fit  your  perception  of  what  each  client  
is expecting; it is important that you be yourself as you meet clients. You also need 
to  consider  the  reality  that  you  will  probably  not  be  able  to  work  effectively  with  
every client. Some clients will work better with counselors who have another type of 
personal and therapeutic style than yours. Be sensitive in assessing what your client 
needs, and use good judgment when determining the appropriateness of the match 
between you and a potential client.
Although you do not have to be like your clients or have experienced the same prob-
lems to be effective with them, it is critical that you be able to understand their world 
and respect them. Ask yourself how well prepared you are to counsel clients from a dif-
ferent cultural background. To what degree do you think you can successfully estab-
lish a therapeutic relationship with a client of a different race? Ethnic group? Gender? 
Age?  Sexual  orientation?  Spiritual/religious  orientation?  Socioeconomic  group?  Do  
you see any potential barriers that would make it difficult for you to form a working 
relationship with certain clients? It is also important to consider the client’s diagnosis, 
resistance  level,  treatment  preferences,  and  stage  of  change.  Therapeutic  techniques  
and styles should be selected to fit the client’s personal characteristics. Norcross and 
Beutler (2014) suggest that therapists create a new therapy for each client:
We believe that the purpose of integrative psychotherapy is not to create a single 
or unitary treatment. Rather, we select different treatment methods according to 
the patient and the context. The result is a more efficient and efficacious therapy—
and one that fits both the client and the clinician. (p. 502)
Postmodern  
approaches
Therapy is a collaborative partnership. Clients are viewed as the experts on their own life. Therapists 
use questioning dialogue to help clients free themselves from their problem-saturated stories and 
create new life-affirming stories. Solution-focused therapists assume an active role in guiding the 
client away from problem-talk and toward solution-talk. Clients are encouraged to explore their 
strengths and to create solutions that will lead to a richer future. Narrative therapists assist clients in 
externalizing problems and guide them in examining self-limiting stories and creating new and more 
liberating stories.
Family systems  
therapy
The family therapist functions as a teacher, coach, model, and consultant. The family learns ways to 
detect and solve problems that are keeping members stuck, and it learns about patterns that have 
been transmitted from generation to generation. Some approaches focus on the role of therapist 
as expert; others concentrate on intensifying what is going on in the here and now of the family 
session. All family therapists are concerned with the process of family interaction and teaching 
patterns of communication.

The Place of Techniques and Evaluation in Counseling
Drawing on Techniques From Various Approaches
Effective  therapists  incorporate  a  wide  range  of  procedures  in  their  thera-
peutic style. Much depends on the purpose of therapy, the setting, the personality 
and  style  of  the  therapist,  the  qualities  of  the  particular  client,  and  the  problems  
selected for intervention. Regardless of the therapeutic model you may be working 
with, you must decide what relationship style to adopt; what techniques, procedures, 
or intervention methods to use; when to use them; and with which clients. Take time 
to review Table 15.5 on therapeutic techniques and Table 15.6 on applications for 
LO6
TabLe 15.5 Techniques of Therapy
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
The key techniques are interpretation, dream analysis, free association, analysis of resistance, analysis 
of transference, and countertransference. Techniques are designed to help clients gain access to their 
unconscious conflicts, which leads to insight and eventual assimilation of new material by the ego.
Adlerian  
therapy
Adlerians pay more attention to the subjective experiences of clients than to using techniques. Some 
techniques include gathering life-history data (family constellation, early recollections, personal 
priorities), sharing interpretations with clients, offering encouragement, and assisting clients in 
searching for new possibilities.
Existential  
therapy
Few techniques flow from this approach because it stresses understanding first and technique 
second. The therapist can borrow techniques from other approaches and incorporate them in an 
existential framework. Diagnosis, testing, and external measurements are not deemed important. 
Issues addressed are freedom and responsibility, isolation and relationships, meaning and 
meaninglessness, living and dying.
Person-centered  
therapy
This approach uses few techniques but stresses the attitudes of the therapist and a “way of being.” 
Therapists strive for active listening, reflection of feelings, clarification, “being there” for the client, 
and focusing on the moment-to-moment experiencing of the client. This model does not include 
diagnostic testing, interpretation, taking a case history, or questioning or probing for information.
Gestalt  
therapy
A wide range of experiments are designed to intensify experiencing and to integrate conflicting 
feelings. Experiments are co-created by therapist and client through an I/Thou dialogue. Therapists 
have latitude to creatively invent their own experiments. Formal diagnosis and testing are not a 
required part of therapy.
Behavior  
therapy
The main techniques are reinforcement, shaping, modeling, systematic desensitization, relaxation 
methods, flooding, eye movement and desensitization reprocessing, cognitive restructuring, social 
skills training, self-management programs, mindfulness and acceptance methods, behavioral 
rehearsal, and coaching. Diagnosis or assessment is done at the outset to determine a treatment 
plan. Questions concentrate on “what,” “how,” and “when” (but not “why”). Contracts and 
homework assignments are also typically used.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Therapists use a variety of cognitive, emotive, and behavioral techniques; diverse methods are tailored 
to suit individual clients. This is an active, directive, time-limited, present-centered, psychoeducational, 
structured therapy. Some techniques include engaging in Socratic dialogue, collaborative empiricism, 
debating irrational beliefs, carrying out homework assignments, gathering data on assumptions one 
has made, keeping a record of activities, forming alternative interpretations, learning new coping skills, 
changing one’s language and thinking patterns, role playing, imagery, confronting faulty beliefs, self-
instructional training, and stress inoculation training.

TabLe 15.6 applications of the approaches
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Candidates for analytic therapy include professionals who want to become therapists, people 
who have had intensive therapy and want to go further, and those who are in psychological pain. 
Analytic therapy is not recommended for self-centered and impulsive individuals or for people with 
psychotic disorders. Techniques can be applied to individual and group therapy.
Adlerian  
therapy
Because the approach is based on a growth model, it is applicable to such varied spheres of life as 
child guidance, parent–child counseling, marital and family therapy, individual counseling with all 
age groups, correctional and rehabilitation counseling, group counseling, substance abuse programs, 
and brief counseling. It is ideally suited to preventive care and alleviating a broad range of conditions 
that interfere with growth.
Existential  
therapy
This approach is especially suited to people facing a developmental crisis or a transition in life 
and for those with existential concerns (making choices, dealing with freedom and responsibility, 
coping with guilt and anxiety, making sense of life, and finding values) or those seeking personal 
enhancement. The approach can be applied to both individual and group counseling, and to couples 
and family therapy, crisis intervention, and community mental health work.
Person-centered  
therapy
Has wide applicability to individual and group counseling. It is especially well suited for the initial 
phases of crisis intervention work. Its principles have been applied to couples and family therapy, 
community programs, administration and management, and human relations training. It is a useful 
approach for teaching, parent–child relations, and for working with groups of people from diverse 
cultural backgrounds.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
This is an active, directive, and didactic therapy. Skillful questioning is a central technique used 
for the duration of the therapy process. Various techniques may be used to get clients to evaluate 
what they are presently doing to see if they are willing to change. If clients decide that their present 
behavior is not effective, they develop a specific plan for change and make a commitment to follow 
through.
Feminist  
therapy
Although techniques from traditional approaches are used, feminist practitioners tend to employ 
consciousness-raising techniques aimed at helping clients recognize the impact of gender-role 
socialization on their lives. Other techniques frequently used include gender-role analysis and 
intervention, power analysis and intervention, demystifying therapy, bibliotherapy, journal writing, 
therapist self-disclosure, assertiveness training, reframing and relabeling, cognitive restructuring, 
identifying and challenging untested beliefs, role playing, psychodramatic methods, group work, 
and social action.
Postmodern  
approaches
In solution-focused therapy the main technique involves change-talk, with emphasis on times 
in a client’s life when the problem was not a problem. Other techniques include creative use 
of questioning, the miracle question, and scaling questions, which assist clients in developing 
alternative stories. In narrative therapy, specific techniques include listening to a client’s 
problem-saturated story without getting stuck, externalizing and naming the problem, 
externalizing conversations, and discovering clues to competence. Narrative therapists often 
write letters to clients and assist them in finding an audience that will support their changes 
and new stories.
Family systems  
therapy
A variety of techniques may be used, depending on the particular theoretical orientation of the 
therapist. Some techniques include genograms, teaching, asking questions, joining the family, 
tracking sequences, family mapping, reframing, restructuring, enactments, and setting boundaries. 
Techniques may be experiential, cognitive, or behavioral in nature. Most are designed to bring about 
change in a short time.

Gestalt  
therapy
Addresses a wide range of problems and populations: crisis intervention, treatment of a range 
of psychosomatic disorders, couples and family therapy, awareness training of mental health 
professionals, behavior problems in children, and teaching and learning. It is well suited to both 
individual and group counseling. The methods are powerful catalysts for opening up feelings and 
getting clients into contact with their present-centered experience.
Behavior  
therapy
A pragmatic approach based on empirical validation of results. Enjoys wide applicability to 
individual, group, couples, and family counseling. Some problems to which the approach is well 
suited are phobic disorders, depression, trauma, sexual disorders, children’s behavioral disorders, 
stuttering, and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Beyond clinical practice, its principles are 
applied in fields such as pediatrics, stress management, behavioral medicine, education, and 
geriatrics.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Has been widely applied to treatment of depression, anxiety, relationship problems, stress 
management, skill training, substance abuse, assertion training, eating disorders, panic attacks, 
performance anxiety, and social phobias. CBT is especially useful for assisting people in modifying 
their cognitions. Many self-help approaches utilize its principles. CBT can be applied to a wide range 
of client populations with a variety of specific problems.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
Geared to teaching people ways of using choice theory in everyday living to increase effective 
behaviors. It has been applied to individual counseling with a wide range of clients, group 
counseling, working with youthful law offenders, and couples and family therapy. In some instances 
it is well suited to brief therapy and crisis intervention.
Feminist  
therapy
Principles and techniques can be applied to a range of therapeutic modalities such as individual 
therapy, relationship counseling, family therapy, group counseling, and community intervention. The 
approach can be applied to both women and men with the goal of bringing about empowerment.
Postmodern  
approaches
Solution-focused therapy is well suited for people with adjustment disorders and for problems of 
anxiety and depression. Narrative therapy is now being used for a broad range of human difficulties 
including eating disorders, family distress, depression, and relationship concerns. These approaches 
can be applied to working with children, adolescents, adults, couples, families, and the community 
in a wide variety of settings. Both solution-focused and narrative approaches lend themselves to 
group counseling and to school counseling.
Family systems  
therapy
Useful for dealing with marital distress, problems of communicating among family members, power 
struggles, crisis situations in the family, helping individuals attain their potential, and enhancing the 
overall functioning of the family.
each approach. Pay careful attention to the focus of each type of therapy and how 
that focus might be useful in your practice.
It is critical to be aware of how clients’ cultural backgrounds contribute to their 
perceptions  of  their  problems.  Each  of  the  11  therapeutic  approaches  has  both  
strengths (Table 15.7) and limitations (Table 15.8) when applied to culturally diverse 
client populations. Although it is unwise to stereotype clients because of their cul-
tural  heritage,  it  is  useful  to  assess  the  bearing  cultural  context  has  on  their  con-
cerns.  Some  techniques  may  be  contraindicated  because  of  a  client’s  socialization.  
The client’s responsiveness (or lack of it) to certain techniques is a critical barometer 
in judging the effectiveness of these methods.
Effective  counseling  involves  proficiency  in  a  combination  of  cognitive,  affec-
tive, and behavioral techniques. Such a combination is necessary to help clients think 
about  their  beliefs  and  assumptions,  to  experience  on  a  feeling  level  their  conflicts

TabLe 15.7 Contributions to Multicultural Counseling
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Its focus on family dynamics is appropriate for working with many cultural groups. The therapist’s 
formality appeals to clients who expect professional distance. Notion of ego defense is helpful in 
understanding inner dynamics and dealing with environmental stresses.
Adlerian  
therapy
Its focus on social interest, helping others, collectivism, pursuing meaning in life, importance of 
family, goal orientation, and belonging is congruent with the values of many cultures. Focus on 
person-in-the-environment allows for cultural factors to be explored.
Existential  
therapy
Focus is on understanding client’s phenomenological world, including cultural background. This approach 
leads to empowerment in an oppressive society. Existential therapy can help clients examine their options 
for change within the context of their cultural realities. The existential approach is particularly suited to 
counseling diverse clients because of the philosophical foundation that emphasizes the human condition.
Person-centered  
therapy
Focus is on breaking cultural barriers and facilitating open dialogue among diverse cultural 
populations. Main strengths are respect for clients’ values, active listening, welcoming of differences, 
nonjudgmental attitude, understanding, willingness to allow clients to determine what will be 
explored in sessions, and prizing cultural pluralism.
Gestalt  
therapy
Its focus on expressing oneself nonverbally is congruent with those cultures that look beyond words 
for messages. Provides many experiments in working with clients who have cultural injunctions 
against freely expressing feelings. Can help to overcome language barrier with bilingual clients. 
Focus on bodily expressions is a subtle way to help clients recognize their conflicts.
Behavior  
therapy
Focus on behavior, rather than on feelings, is compatible with many cultures. Strengths include a 
collaborative relationship between counselor and client in working toward mutually agreed-upon goals, 
continual assessment to determine if the techniques are suited to clients’ unique situations, assisting 
clients in learning practical skills, an educational focus, and stress on self-management strategies.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Focus is on a collaborative approach that offers clients opportunities to express their areas of 
concern. The psychoeducational dimensions are often useful in exploring cultural conflicts and 
teaching new behavior. The emphasis on thinking (as opposed to identifying and expressing feelings) 
is likely to be acceptable to many clients. The focus on teaching and learning tends to avoid the 
stigma of mental illness. Clients are likely to value the active and directive stance of the therapist.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
Focus is on clients making their own evaluation of behavior (including how they respond to their 
culture). Through personal assessment clients can determine the degree to which their needs and 
wants are being satisfied. They can find a balance between retaining their own ethnic identity and 
integrating some of the values and practices of the dominant society.
Feminist  
therapy
Focus is on both individual change and social transformation. A key contribution is that both the 
women’s movement and the multicultural movement have called attention to the negative impact 
of discrimination and oppression for both women and men. Emphasizes the influence of expected 
cultural roles and explores client’s satisfaction with and knowledge of these roles.
Postmodern  
approaches
Focus is on the social and cultural context of behavior. Stories that are being authored in the therapy 
office need to be anchored in the social world in which the client lives. Therapists do not make 
assumptions about people and honor each client’s unique story and cultural background. Therapists 
take an active role in challenging social and cultural injustices that lead to oppression of certain 
groups. Therapy becomes a process of liberation from oppressive cultural values and enables clients 
to become active agents of their destinies.
Family systems  
therapy
Focus is on the family or community system. Many ethnic and cultural groups place value on the role 
of the extended family. Many family therapies deal with extended family members and with support 
systems. Networking is a part of the process, which is congruent with the values of many clients. There 
is a greater chance for individual change if other family members are supportive. This approach offers 
ways of working toward the health of the family unit and the welfare of each member.

TabLe 15.8 Limitations in Multicultural Counseling
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Its focus on insight, intrapsychic dynamics, and long-term treatment is often not valued by clients 
who prefer to learn coping skills for dealing with pressing daily concerns. Internal focus is often in 
conflict with cultural values that stress an interpersonal and environmental focus.
Adlerian  
therapy
This approach’s detailed interview about one’s family background can conflict with cultures that 
have injunctions against disclosing family matters. Some clients may view the counselor as an 
authority who will provide answers to problems, which conflicts with the egalitarian, person-to-
person spirit as a way to reduce social distance.
Existential  
therapy
Values of individuality, freedom, autonomy, and self-realization often conflict with cultural values of 
collectivism, respect for tradition, deference to authority, and interdependence. Some may be deterred 
by the absence of specific techniques. Others will expect more focus on surviving in their world.
Person-centered  
therapy
Some of the core values of this approach may not be congruent with the client’s culture. Lack of 
counselor direction and structure are unacceptable for clients who are seeking help and immediate 
answers from a knowledgeable professional.
Gestalt  
therapy
Clients who have been culturally conditioned to be emotionally reserved may not embrace Gestalt 
experiments. Some may not see how “being aware of present experiencing” will lead to solving their problems.
Behavior  
therapy
Family members may not value clients’ newly acquired assertive style, so clients must be taught how 
to cope with resistance by others. Counselors need to help clients assess the possible consequences 
of making behavioral changes.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Before too quickly attempting to change the beliefs and actions of clients, it is essential for the 
therapist to understand and respect their world. Some clients may have serious reservations about 
questioning their basic cultural values and beliefs. Clients could become dependent on the therapist 
choosing appropriate ways to solve problems.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
This approach stresses taking charge of one’s own life, yet some clients are more interested in 
changing their external environment. Counselors need to appreciate the role of discrimination and 
racism and help clients deal with social and political realities.
Feminist  
therapy
This model has been criticized for its bias toward the values of White, middle-class, heterosexual 
women, which are not applicable to many other groups of women nor to men. Therapists need to 
assess with their clients the price of making significant personal change, which may result in isolation 
from extended family as clients assume new roles and make life changes.
Postmodern  
approaches
Some clients come to therapy wanting to talk about their problems and may be put off by the 
insistence on talking about exceptions to their problems. Clients may view the therapist as an expert 
and be reluctant to view themselves as experts. Certain clients may doubt the helpfulness of a 
therapist who assumes a “not-knowing” position.
Family systems  
therapy
Family therapy rests on value assumptions that are not congruent with the values of clients from 
some cultures. Western concepts such as individuation, self-actualization, self-determination, 
independence, and self-expression may be foreign to some clients. In some cultures, admitting 
problems within the family is shameful. The value of “keeping problems within the family” may make 
it difficult to explore conflicts openly.

approaches, and Table 15.10 describes some of the limitations of the various thera-
peutic approaches. These tables will help you identify elements that you may want 
to incorporate in your own counseling perspective.

TabLe 15.9 Contributions of the approaches
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
More than any other system, this approach has generated controversy as well as exploration 
and has stimulated further thinking and development of therapy. It has provided a detailed and 
comprehensive description of personality structure and functioning. It has brought into prominence 
factors such as the unconscious as a determinant of behavior and the role of trauma during the first 
six years of life. It has developed several techniques for tapping the unconscious and shed light on 
the dynamics of transference and countertransference, resistance, anxiety, and the mechanisms of 
ego defense.
Adlerian  
therapy
A key contribution is the influence that Adlerian concepts have had on other systems and 
the integration of these concepts into various contemporary therapies. This is one of the first 
approaches to therapy that was humanistic, unified, holistic, and goal-oriented and that put an 
emphasis on social and psychological factors.
Existential  
therapy
Its major contribution is recognition of the need for a subjective approach based on a complete 
view of the human condition. It calls attention to the need for a philosophical statement on what 
it means to be a person. Stress on the I/Thou relationship lessens the chances of dehumanizing 
therapy. It provides a perspective for understanding anxiety, guilt, freedom, death, isolation, and 
commitment.
Person-centered  
therapy
Clients take an active stance and assume responsibility for the direction of therapy. This unique 
approach has been subjected to empirical testing, and as a result both theory and methods have 
been modified. It is an open system. People without advanced training can benefit by translating 
the therapeutic conditions to both their personal and professional lives. Basic concepts are 
straightforward and easy to grasp and apply. It is a foundation for building a trusting relationship, 
applicable to all therapies.
Gestalt  
therapy
The emphasis on direct experiencing and doing rather than on merely talking about feelings 
provides a perspective on growth and enhancement, not merely a treatment of disorders. It uses 
clients’ behavior as the basis for making them aware of their inner creative potential. The approach 
to dreams is a unique, creative tool to help clients discover basic conflicts. Therapy is viewed as 
an existential encounter; it is process-oriented, not technique-oriented. It recognizes nonverbal 
behavior as a key to understanding.
Behavior  
therapy
Emphasis is on assessment and evaluation techniques, thus providing a basis for accountable 
practice. Specific problems are identified, and clients are kept informed about progress toward 
their goals. The approach has demonstrated effectiveness in many areas of human functioning. 
The roles of the therapist as reinforcer, model, teacher, and consultant are explicit. The approach 
has undergone extensive expansion, and research literature abounds. No longer is it a mechanistic 
approach, for it now makes room for cognitive factors and encourages self-directed programs for 
behavioral change.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Major contributions include emphasis on a comprehensive therapeutic practice; numerous 
cognitive, emotive, and behavioral techniques; an openness to incorporating techniques from 
other approaches; and a methodology for challenging and changing faulty or negative thinking. 
Most forms can be integrated into other mainstream therapies. REBT makes full use of action-
oriented homework, various psychoeducational methods, and keeping records of progress. CT is 
a structured therapy that has a good track record for treating depression and anxiety in a short 
time. Strengths-based CBT is a form of positive psychology that addresses the resources within 
the client for change.
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
This is a positive approach with an action orientation that relies on simple and clear concepts 
that are easily grasped in many helping professions. It can be used by teachers, nurses, ministers, 
educators, social workers, and counselors. Due to the direct methods, it appeals to many clients who 
are often seen as resistant to therapy. It is a short-term approach that can be applied to a diverse 
population, and it has been a significant force in challenging the medical model of therapy.

Feminist  
therapy
The feminist perspective is responsible for encouraging increasing numbers of women to question 
gender stereotypes and to reject limited views of what a woman is expected to be. It is paving 
the way for gender-sensitive practice and bringing attention to the gendered uses of power in 
relationships. The unified feminist voice brought attention to the extent and implications of child 
abuse, incest, rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Feminist principles and interventions 
can be incorporated in other therapy approaches.
Postmodern  
approaches
The brevity of these approaches fit well with the limitations imposed by a managed care structure. 
The emphasis on client strengths and competence appeals to clients who want to create solutions 
and revise their life stories in a positive direction. Clients are not blamed for their problems but are 
helped to understand how they might relate in more satisfying ways to such problems. A strength 
of these approaches is the question format that invites clients to view themselves in new and more 
effective ways.
Family systems  
therapy
From a systemic perspective, neither the individual nor the family is blamed for a particular 
dysfunction. The family is empowered through the process of identifying and exploring interactional 
patterns. Working with an entire unit provides a new perspective on understanding and working 
through both individual problems and relationship concerns. By exploring one’s family of origin, 
there are increased opportunities to resolve other conflicts in systems outside of the family
TabLe 15.10 Limitations of the approaches
Psychoanalytic  
therapy
Requires lengthy training for therapists and much time and expense for clients. The model stresses 
biological and instinctual factors to the neglect of social, cultural, and interpersonal ones. Its methods 
are less applicable for solving specific daily life problems of clients and may not be appropriate for 
some ethnic and cultural groups. Many clients lack the degree of ego strength needed for regressive 
and reconstructive therapy. It may be inappropriate for certain counseling settings.
Adlerian  
therapy
Weak in terms of precision, testability, and empirical validity. Few attempts have been made to 
validate the basic concepts by scientific methods. Tends to oversimplify some complex human 
problems and is based heavily on common sense.
Existential  
therapy
Many basic concepts are fuzzy and ill-defined, making its general framework abstract at times. Lacks 
a systematic statement of principles and practices of therapy. Has limited applicability to lower 
functioning and nonverbal clients and to clients in extreme crisis who need direction.
Person-centered  
therapy
Possible danger from the therapist who remains passive and inactive, limiting responses to reflection. 
Many clients feel a need for greater direction, more structure, and more techniques. Clients in crisis 
may need more directive measures. Applied to individual counseling, some cultural groups will 
expect more counselor activity.
Gestalt  
therapy
Techniques lead to intense emotional expression; if these feelings are not explored and if cognitive 
work is not done, clients are likely to be left unfinished and will not have a sense of integration 
of their learning. Clients who have difficulty using imagination may not profit from certain 
experiments.
Behavior  
therapy
Major criticisms are that it may change behavior but not feelings; that it ignores the relational factors 
in therapy; that it does not provide insight; that it ignores historical causes of present behavior; that 
it involves control by the therapist; and that it is limited in its capacity to address certain aspects of 
the human condition.
Cognitive behavior  
therapy
Tends to play down emotions, does not focus on exploring the unconscious or underlying conflicts, 
de-emphasizes the value of insight, and sometimes does not give enough weight to the client’s past. 
CBT might be too structured for some clients.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Counseling and Therapy
Mental  health  providers  must  be  accountable  and  be  able  to  demonstrate  
the  efficacy  of  their  services.  In  the  era  of  managed  care,  it  is  essential  for  practi-
tioners  to  demonstrate  the  degree  to  which  their  interventions  are  both  clinically  
sound  and  cost-effective.  Does  therapy  make  a  significant  difference?  Are  people  
substantially better after therapy than they were without it? Can therapy actually be 
more harmful than helpful?
Evaluating how well psychotherapy works is far from simple. Therapeutic sys-
tems  are  applied  by  practitioners  who  have  unique  individual  characteristics,  and  
clients themselves have much to do with therapeutic outcomes. For example, effects 
resulting from unexpected and uncontrollable events in the client’s social environ-
ment can lessen the impact of gains made in psychotherapy. Moreover, practitioners 
who adhere to the same approach are likely to use techniques in various ways and to 
relate to clients in diverse fashions, functioning differently with different clients and 
in different clinical settings.
How effective is psychotherapy? A meta-analysis of psychotherapy outcome lit-
erature conducted by Smith, Glass, and Miller (1980) concluded that psychotherapy 
was highly effective and that all psychotherapeutic approaches worked about equally 
well. Prochaska and Norcross (2014) note that controlled outcome research consis-
tently supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy. They point out that more than 
5,000 individual studies and 500 meta-analyses have been conducted on the effec-
tiveness  of  psychotherapy;  these  studies  demonstrate  that  well-developed  therapy  
interventions have meaningful, positive effects on the intended outcome variables. 
In short, not only does psychotherapy work, but research demonstrates that therapy 
is remarkably effective. Psychotherapy is an efficacious approach to helping people 
who experience psychological distress improve their functioning (Miller et al., 2015).
LO7
Choice theory/ 
Reality therapy
Discounts the therapeutic value of exploration of the client’s past, dreams, the unconscious, early 
childhood experiences, and transference. The approach is limited to less complex problems. It is a 
problem-solving therapy that tends to discourage exploration of deeper emotional issues.
Feminist  
therapy
A possible limitation is the potential for therapists to impose a new set of values on clients—such as 
striving for equality, power in relationships, defining oneself, freedom to pursue a career outside the 
home, and the right to an education. Therapists need to keep in mind that clients are their own best 
experts, which means it is up to them to decide which values to live by.
Postmodern  
approaches
There is little empirical validation of the effectiveness of therapy outcomes. Some critics contend 
that these approaches endorse cheerleading and an overly positive perspective. Some are critical of 
the stance taken by most postmodern therapists regarding assessment and diagnosis, and also react 
negatively to the “not-knowing” stance of the therapist. Because some of the solution-focused and 
narrative therapy techniques are relatively easy to learn, practitioners may use these interventions 
in a mechanical way or implement these techniques without a sound rationale.
Family systems  
therapy
Limitations include problems in being able to involve all the members of a family in the therapy. 
Some family members may be resistant to changing the structure of the system. Therapists’ self-
knowledge and willingness to work on their own family-of-origin issues is crucial, for the potential 
for countertransference is high. It is essential that the therapist be well trained, receive quality 
supervision, and be competent in assessing and treating individuals in a family context.

AN INTEgRATIVE PERsPECTIVE         451 
A summary of the research data shows little or no difference in outcome between 
specific therapeutic approaches (Miller et al., 2015). Lambert’s (2011) review of psy-
chotherapy research makes it clear that the similarities rather than the differences 
among models account for the effectiveness of psychotherapy. Interpersonal, social, 
and affective factors common across therapeutic orientations are the primary deter-
minants of effectiveness (Elkins, 2016).
Although it is clear that therapy works, there are no simple explanations of how 
it works. Research indicates that a variety of treatments are equally effective—when 
administered by therapists who believe in them and when they are accepted by the 
client.  Wampold  (2010)  concludes  that  “there  is  little  evidence  that  the  specific  
ingredients of any treatment are responsible for the benefits of therapy” (p. 71).
The various therapy approaches and techniques work equally well because they 
share the most important ingredient accounting for change—the client. Data point 
to the conclusion that the engine of change is the client (Bohart & Tallman, 2010; 
Bohart & Wade, 2013), and we can most productively direct our efforts toward ways 
of employing the client in the process of change.
Feedback-Informed Treatment
Listening to client feedback about the therapy process is of the utmost impor-
tance. Feedback-informed treatment (F
it) is designed to evaluate and to improve  
the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  counseling  services.  FIT  is  an  evidence-based  
practice that monitors client change and identifies modifications needed to enhance 
the  therapeutic  endeavor  (Miller  et  al.,  2015).  FIT  involves  consistently  obtaining  
feedback from clients regarding the therapeutic relationship and their clinical prog-
ress, which is then used to tailor therapy to their unique needs. If therapists learn to 
listen to clients’ feedback throughout the therapeutic process, clients can become 
full and equal participants in all aspects of their therapy (Miller et al., 2015).
Monitoring  outcome  and  adjusting  accordingly  on  the  basis  of  feedback  from  
the client must become routine practice. The client’s theory of change can be used as 
a basis for determining which approach, by whom, can be most effective for this per-
son, with his or her specific problem, under this particular set of circumstances. This 
approach to practice requires continuous active client input, which is the most sig-
nificant predictor of change in therapy (Hubble, Duncan, Miller, & Wampold, 2010).
Duncan  (2014)  believes  that  systematic  client  feedback  should  be  integrated  
into all psychotherapeutic approaches because of its proven effectiveness in help-
ing  clients  monitor  and  improve  their  therapy  experience.  Scott  Miller  and  his  
associates at the International Center for Clinical Excellence (ICCE) developed two 
4-item instruments to measure client progress and to rate the quality of the thera-
peutic relationship. These rating instruments are brief, well-validated, client-rated 
scales.  The  Outcome  
rating  scale  (Ors)  assesses  the  client’s  therapeutic  prog-
ress  through  ratings  of  a  client’s  personal  experience  of  well-being  in  his  or  her  
individual, interpersonal, and social functioning. The 
session rating scale (srs) 
measures a client’s perception of the quality of the therapeutic relationship, which 
includes the relational bond with the therapist, the perceived collaboration around 
specific tasks in therapy, and agreement on goals, methods, and client preferences 
(Miller et al., 2015).

Feedback from clients regarding the therapeutic alliance and outcomes increases 
the effect of treatment, cuts dropout rates in half, and decreases the risk of deteriora-
tion (Miller, 2011). Using client feedback, therapists can adjust and accommodate 
to maximize beneficial outcomes for clients. In essence, Duncan, Miller, and Sparks 
(2004)  are  arguing  for  practice-based  evidence  rather  than  evidence-based  practice:  
“Becoming  outcome  informed  not  only  amplifies  the  client’s  voice  but  offers  the  
most  viable,  research-tested  method  to  improve  clinical  effectiveness”  (p.  16).  Cli-
ent strengths and perceptions are the foundation of therapy work. Systematic and 
consistent  assessment  of  the  client’s  perceptions  of  progress  allows  the  therapist  
to customize the therapy to the individual needs and characteristics of each client. 
Ongoing client feedback provides practitioners with a simple, practical, and mean-
ingful method for documenting the usefulness of treatment.
I
n this section, I describe how I would integrate con-
cepts  and  techniques  from  the  11  theoretical  per-
spectives  in  counseling  Stan  on  the  levels  of  thinking, 
feeling, and doing. I indicate what aspects from the vari-
ous theories I would draw on in working with Stan at 
the various stages of his therapy. As you read the Ques-
tions  for  Reflection  at  the  end  of  this  section,  think  
about how you would work with Stan from your own 
integrative perspective.
clarifying the therapeutic relationship
In  establishing  the  therapeutic  relationship,  I  am  in-
fluenced  by  the  person-centered,  existential,  Gestalt,  
feminist, postmodern, and Adlerian approaches. I ask 
myself  these  questions:  “To  what  degree  am  I  able  to  
listen  to  and  hear  Stan  in  a  nonjudgmental  way?  Am  
I  able  to  respect  and  care  for  him?  Do  I  have  the  ca-
pacity to enter his subjective world without losing my 
own  identity?  Am  I  able  to  share  with  him  my  own  
thoughts and reactions as they pertain to our relation-
ship?” I invite Stan’s questions about this therapeutic 
relationship. One goal is to demystify the therapy pro-
cess; another is to get some focus for the direction of 
our sessions by developing clear goals for the therapy.
clarifying the goals of therapy
With respect to setting goals, precision and clarity are 
essential. Once we have identified some goals, Stan can 
begin to observe and measure his own behavior, both in 
the sessions and in his daily life. This self-monitoring is 
a vital step in any effort to bring about change. I will be 
asking for Stan’s feedback throughout the therapeutic 
process and will use his feedback as a basis for making 
modifications in our therapeutic alliance.
Throughout our time together, I ask Stan to decide 
time and again what he wants from his therapy and to 
assess the degree to which our work together is helping 
him  meet  his  goals.  It  is  important  that  Stan  provide  
the direction in which he wants to travel on his journey. 
Once I have a clear sense of the specific ways Stan wants 
to change how he is thinking, feeling, and acting, I am 
likely to take an active role in co-creating experiments 
with Stan that he can do both in the therapy sessions 
and on his own away from our sessions.
Working With stan’s Past, Present,  
and Future
Dealing With the Past In my integrative approach, 
I tend to give weight to understanding, exploring, and 
working with Stan’s early history and to connect his 
past with what he is doing today. My view is that themes 
running through our life can become evident if we come 
to terms with significant experiences in our childhood. I 
favor the Gestalt approach of asking Stan to bring into 
the here and now those people in his life with whom 
he feels unfinished. A variety of role-playing techniques 
in which Stan addresses significant others through 
symbolic work in our sessions will bring Stan’s past 
intensely to life in the present moment of our sessions.

Dealing With the Present Being interested in 
Stan’s past does not mean that we get lost in history 
or that we dwell on reliving traumatic situations. By 
paying attention to what is going on in the here and 
now during the counseling session, I get significant 
clues about what is unfinished from Stan’s past. 
He and I can direct attention to his immediate 
feelings as well as to his thoughts and actions. It 
seems essential to me that we work with all three 
dimensions—what he is thinking, what he is actually 
doing, and how his thoughts and behaviors affect 
his feeling states.
Dealing With the Future If Stan decides that his 
present behavior is not getting him what he wants, 
he is in a good position to think ahead about the 
changes he would like to make and what he can do 
now to actualize his aspirations. The present-oriented 
behavioral focus of reality therapy is a good reference 
point for getting Stan to dream about what he would 
like to say about his life five years hence. Connecting 
present behavior with future plans is an excellent 
way to help Stan formulate a concrete plan of action, 
which can give him a way to create his future.
identifying and exploring Feelings
The authenticity of my relationship with Stan encour-
ages him to begin to identify and share with me a range 
of feelings. Our open and trusting relationship is not 
sufficient  to  change  Stan’s  personality  and  behavior,  
however,  and  I  continue  to  use  my  knowledge,  skills,  
and experiences to help Stan clarify his own thoughts. 
Stan is the best expert on his own life, and I assist him 
in coming to value the ways in which he is the expert 
in the therapeutic endeavor as well.
I draw heavily on Gestalt experiments to help Stan 
express and explore his feelings. Eventually, I ask him 
to  avoid  merely  talking  about  situations  and  about  
feelings.  Rather,  I  encourage  him  to  bring  whatever  
reactions  he  is  having  into  the  present.  For  instance,  
if I notice tears in his eyes, I may direct him to “be his 
tears now.” By putting words to his tears, he avoids ab-
stract intellectualization about all the reasons he is sad 
or tense. Before he can change his feelings, Stan must 
allow himself to fully experience them. The experiential 
therapies provide valuable tools for guiding him to the 
expression of his feelings.
the thinking Dimension in therapy
Once Stan has experienced some intense feelings and 
perhaps   released   pent-up   feelings,   some   cognitive   
work is essential. To bring in this cognitive dimension, 
I  focus  Stan’s  attention  on  messages  he  incorporated  
as a child and on the decisions he made. I get him to 
think  about  the  reason  he  made  certain  early  deci-
sions.  Finally,  I  challenge  Stan  to  look  at  these  deci-
sions about life, about himself, and about others and 
to make necessary revisions that can lead him to creat-
ing a life of his own choosing.
The cognitive behavioral therapies have a range of 
cognitive techniques that can help Stan recognize con-
nections between his cognitions and his behaviors. Over 
a  number  of  sessions  we  work  on  specific  beliefs.  My  
role  is  to  promote  corrective  experiences  that  will  lead  
to changes in his thinking. Eventually, our goal is some 
cognitive  restructuring  work  by  which  Stan  can  learn  
new ways to think, new things to tell himself, and new 
assumptions  about  life.  I  have  given  Stan  a  number  of  
homework assignments aimed at helping him identify a 
range of feelings and thoughts that may be problematic 
for him. This provides a basis for change in his behavior.
Doing: another essential component  
of 
therapy
Feeling   and   thinking   are   not   a   complete   therapy   
process. Doing  is  a  way  of  bringing  these  feelings  and  
thoughts  together  by  applying  them  to  real-life  situ-
ations in various action programs. I ask Stan to think 
of  as  many  ways  as  possible  of  actually  bringing  into  
his daily living the new learning he is acquiring in our 
sessions.   Homework   assignments   (preferably   ones   
that  Stan  gives  himself)  are  an  excellent  way  for  Stan  
to  become  an  active  agent  in  his  therapy.  He  must  do 
something himself for change to occur. The degree to 
which  he  will  change  is  directly  proportional  to  his  
willingness to experiment. Thus, each week we discuss 
his  progress  toward  meeting  his  goals,  and  we  review  
how well he is completing his assignments, as well as 
how his action plan is working.
Moving toward termination of therapy
Termination  of  therapy  is  as  important  as  the  initial  
phase, for now the key task is to put into practice what 
he  has  learned  in  the  sessions  by  applying  new  skills

and attitudes to daily social situations without profes-

it  alone,”  we  talk  about  his  readiness  to  end  therapy  
and his reasons for thinking about termination. I also 
share with him my perceptions of the directions I have 
seen him take. This is a good time to talk about where 
he can go from here. We spend time developing an ac-
tion plan and talking about how he can best maintain 
his new learning.
In a behavioral spirit, evaluating the process and 
outcomes of therapy seems essential. This evaluation 
can take the form of devoting some time to discuss-
ing Stan’s specific changes in therapy. A few questions 
for  focus  are:  “What  stands  out  the  most  for  you,  
Stan? What did you learn that you consider the most 
valuable? How did you learn these lessons? What can 
you do now to keep practicing new behaviors? What 
will you do if you experience a setback?” We explore 
potential  difficulties  he  expects  to  face  when  he  no  
longer  comes  to  weekly  counseling  sessions.  At  this  
point, I introduce some relapse prevention strategies 
to  help  Stan  cope  constructively  with  future  prob-
lems.  By  addressing  potential  problems  and  stum-
bling  blocks  that  he  might  have  to  deal  with,  Stan  
is less likely to become discouraged if he experiences 
any setbacks. If any relapses do occur, we talk about 
seeing  these  as  “learning  opportunities”  rather  than  
as  signs  that  he  has  failed.  I  let  Stan  know  that  his  
termination of formal therapy does not mean that he 
cannot return for a visit or session when he considers 
it appropriate.
commentary on the thinking, Feeling, 
and Doing Perspective
Although the steps I described with Stan may appear 
relatively structured and even simple, actually work-
ing with clients is more complex and less predictable. 
If  you  are  practicing  from  an  integrative  perspec-
tive,  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  assume  that  it  is  best  
to always begin working with what clients are think-
ing (or feeling or doing). Effective counseling begins 
where the client is, not where a theory indicates a cli-
ent should be.
In  summary,  depending  on  what  clients  need  at  
the  moment,  I  may  focus  initially  on  what  they  are  
thinking and how this is affecting them, or I may focus 
on how they feel, or I may choose to direct them to pay 
attention  to  what  they  are  doing.  If  Stan  can  change  
his  thoughts,  I  believe  he  is  likely  to  change  some  of  
his  behaviors  and  his  feelings.  If  he  changes  his  feel-
ings, he might well begin to think and act differently. 
If he changes certain behaviors, he may begin thinking 
and feeling differently. Because these facets of human 
experience  are  interrelated,  one  route  generally  leads  
to the other dimensions.
A   person-centered   focus   respects   the   wisdom   
within the client and uses it as a lead for where to go 
next. As counselors, a mistake we can make is getting 
too far ahead of our clients by thinking, “What should 
I  do  next?”  By  staying  with  our  clients  and  asking  
them what they want, they will tell us which direction 
to take either directly or indirectly. We can learn to pay 
attention  to  our  own  reactions  to  our  clients  and  to  
our own energy. By doing so we can engage in a thera-
peutic  connection  that  is  helpful  for  both  parties  in  
the relationship.
Questions for Reflection
What themes in Stan’s life do you find most sig-
nificant, and how might you draw on these themes 
during the initial phase of counseling?
What specific concepts from the various theoreti-
cal orientations would you be most inclined to 
utilize in your work with Stan?
Identify some key techniques from the various 
therapies that you are most likely to employ in 
your therapy with Stan.
How would you develop experiments for Stan 
to carry out both inside and outside the therapy 
sessions?
Knowing what you do about Stan, what do you 
imagine it would be like to be his therapist? What 
problems, if any, might you expect to encounter in 
your counseling relationship with him?

from  this  perspective.  This  session  deals  with  
termination  and  takes  an  integrative  view  of  
stan’s work.

AN INTEgRATIVE PERsPECTIVE         455 
T
here  are  multiple  pathways  to  health  and  well-
being, and I believe Gwen can benefit from a va-
riety of counseling theories and holistic practices. The 
integrative approach embraces an attitude that affirms 
the  intrinsic  value  of  each  individual.  It  is  a  unifying  
approach  that  attends  to  the  person  at  the  affective,  
behavioral, cognitive, and physiological levels of func-
tioning. It also addresses the spiritual dimension of a 
client’s life.
As an integrative therapist and a woman of color, 
I am willing to share my experiences with Gwen when 
it is therapeutically appropriate. I want Gwen to know 
that I respect her life experiences, struggles, strengths, 
unique qualities, and personal reality. I see Gwen as an 
intelligent African American woman with great depth 
and  wisdom.  Utilizing  an  integrative  approach  with  
Gwen allows me to take into account the many views 
of the change process that are available to assist her at 
this time in her life.
In  my  initial  interview  with  Gwen,  I  let  her  know  
that  I  am  not  a  purist  in  my  approach  to  therapy  and  
that I will draw from different counseling theories to cre-
ate a treatment approach that is tailored to her needs. I 
begin  establishing  a  therapeutic  alliance  with  Gwen  by  
drawing  heavily  from  a  client-centered  orientation  It  is  
important  for  me  to  extend  unconditional  positive  re-
gard  in  the  midst  of  acknowledging  the  suffering  and  
anxiety  Gwen  is  experiencing  in  her  day-to-day  life.  I  
want Gwen to know that she is the expert on her life and 
that  she  is  in  charge  of  our  work  together.  I  will  intro-
duce ideas and techniques, and I let Gwen know that she 
is free to say what does not work for her in our sessions.
When Gwen and I began our therapeutic journey 
together,  I  was  very  interested  in  learning  about  her  
family  history.  I  encouraged  Gwen  to  create  a  geno-
gram  that  depicted  three  generations  and  indicated  
educational levels, health issues, relationship patterns, 
and religious orientation. This approach was borrowed 
from  family  therapy  and  assisted  us  in  seeing  family  
patterns that have given her strength and support (her 
spirituality), as well as patterns that have caused chal-
lenges for her (taking on family members’ problems). 
Through exploring her family history, Gwen begins to 
slowly recognize she has taken on characteristics that 
don’t  necessarily  belong  to  her.  Generational  trans-
mission—passing down traits, habits, and values from 
one generation to the next—has predisposed Gwen to 
be a rescuer like many of her female relatives. She ex-
plores  some  of  the  old  automatic  negative  thoughts  
that were passed on from other generations that keep 
her feeling overwhelmed. One of Gwen’s faulty beliefs 
is that “If I don’t do it, no one else will.” This particular 
cognitive  distortion  keeps  her  is  a  spiral  of  doing  ev-
erything without reaching out to others for assistance 
or  support.  Her  belief  that  no  one  else  can  assist  her  
has caused fatigue and frustration. Through cognitive 
behavior  therapy,  Gwen  becomes  more  aware  of  the  
thoughts she is thinking and how they affect how she 
feels about herself.
Using an integrative format allows me to incorpo-
rate everything Gwen brings to therapy as a route to her 
own healing process. Gwen shared with me early in our 
sessions  that  her  relationship  with  God  was  a  source  
of great strength in her life. I acknowledge and respect 
Gwen’s spiritual values, and I pay attention to how her 
spirituality  can  be  a  significant  part  of  her  treatment  
and  healing.  Spirituality  became  a  central  part  of  our  
therapy  sessions  because  Gwen  made  it  clear  that  her  
spiritual beliefs were a vital resource for her.
I asked Gwen to talk about what was most helpful 
about  the  way  she  worshiped.  Gwen  replied,  “I  enjoy  
reading the scriptures. It helps me to see that I am not 
alone  and  that  my  problems  are  not  new.  There  are  
messages that I can reflect on in scripture. Reading the 
Bible  gives  me  comfort  in  my  spirit.”  We  explore  the  
existential  questions  around  the  meaning  in  life  and  
talk  about  suffering,  anxiety,  and  death.  Gwen  strug-
gles with fears for her son’s life, and she feels great sad-
ness as her mother’s health declines. Gwen’s spiritual-
ity is becoming her anchor and support as she wrestles 
with these realities of life.
Bringing  in  the  dimension  of  spirituality  recon-
nects Gwen to a daily practice of reading scripture in 
the morning and listening to praise music on the way

to  the  office.  Gwen  notices  that  her  mood  is  not  as  
negative when she engages in her daily spiritual prac-
tice.  She  hadn’t  realized  that  she  had  stopped  engag-
ing in activities that kept her focused and uplifted. The 
stress of taking care of her mother and juggling work 
and family life created an imbalance that perpetuated 
faulty cognitions and behaviors.
In our early sessions Gwen engaged in automatic 
negative thinking and made statements such as “I am 
never going to feel healthy again.” “My children never 
want  to  spend  time  with  me.”  “I  will  always  feel  iso-
lated.”  Examining  Gwen’s  cognitive  distortions  and  
assisting her in noticing and challenging them helped 
her to become increasingly aware of how these thought 
patterns cause her distress.
I  introduced  Gwen  to  a  simple  5-minute  medita-
tion practice aimed at both calming her mind of anxious 
thoughts and increasing her ability to focus. I suggested 
to  Gwen  that  during  these  brief  meditations  she  could  
notice  her  thoughts  without  judgment.  This  simple  
mindfulness  practice  is  likely  to  have  a  cumulative  im-
pact  on  her  ability  to  relax  and  gain  more  inner  resil-
ience. With continued practice, Gwen discovers that she 
is not simply her thoughts, that she can be the observer 
of those thoughts, and that she can watch them flow by 
rather than letting them control her behavior and mood.
I typically begin and end each session with a brief 
assessment  by  Gwen  about  the  session.  I  depend  on  
regular feedback to make the process truly collabora-
tive  and  to  ensure  that  Gwen’s  therapeutic  needs  are  
being met. My first question for Gwen is always: “How 
would you like to best use the time we have together?” 
My  job  is  to  be  fully  present  so  that  I  can  effectively  
integrate therapeutic approaches that will assist Gwen 
on  her  journey  of  transformation  as  she  returns  to  a  
state of optimal functioning and balance.
I make no assumptions and ask Gwen if she is will-
ing  to  work  with  what  naturally  arises  as  the  therapy  
progresses. If she does not give an affirmative answer, 
then  our  direction  of  therapy  needs  to  be  modified.  I  
explain that my techniques are aimed at meeting Gw-
en’s goals and healing her needs. This statement seems 
to increase Gwen’s comfort level, and she is more will-
ing to try new ways of being in a session.
To decrease Gwen’s symptoms of depression and 
anxiety,  I  introduce  her  to  a  process  I  call  “transfor-
mative movement and reflection.” I teach Gwen a vari-
ety of techniques, range from subtle to dynamic, that 
come  from  global  healing  practices  such  as  yoga,  tai  
chi,  drumming,  and  yogic  pranayama,  to  mention  a  
few. These activities increase mindfulness and present 
moment awareness and help Gwen release tension and 
stress  from  her  body  and  mind.  The  movement  prac-
tices also assist in healthy emotional expression. Gwen 
is  not  very  interested  in  drumming,  but  listening  to  
music and moving is relaxing for her while in session 
and at home. Gwen begins to see that she has resourc-
es and tools that she can use in moments of stress in 
her daily life. My goal is to introduce Gwen to multiple 
tools to heal on the levels of mind, body, and spirit. I 
am  sensitive  to  Gwen’s  personal  goals  from  the  mo-
ment  she  walks  into  my  office,  and  I  remain  open  to  
the possibilities that lie ahead of us until the very end.
Questions for Reflection
What ideas and techniques shared in this piece 
belong to each theoretical approach?
How comfortable are you in introducing nontradi-
tional therapeutic techniques?
Based on who you are, what theories seem to be the 
most natural for you to utilize from an integrative 
theoretical approach when working with Gwen?
Summary
Creating an integrative stance is truly a challenge. Therapists cannot simply pick 
bits and pieces from theories in a random and fragmented manner. In forming 
an integrated perspective, it is important to ask: Which theories provide a basis 
for understanding the cognitive dimensions? What about the feeling aspects? And 
how  about  the  behavioral  dimension?  Most  of  the  11  therapeutic  orientations

discussed here focus primarily on one of these dimensions of human experience. 
Although the other dimensions are not necessarily ignored, they are often given 
short shrift.
Developing an integrated theoretical perspective requires an accurate, in-depth 
knowledge of the various theories. Without such knowledge, you cannot formulate 
a  true  synthesis.  Simply  put,  you  cannot  integrate  what  you  do  not  know  (Nor-
cross & Beutler, 2014). A central message of this book has been to remain open to 
each theory, to do further reading, and to reflect on how the key concepts of each 
approach fit your personality. Building your personalized orientation to counseling, 
which is based on what you consider to be the best features of several theories, is a 
long-term venture.
In addition to considering your own personality, think about what concepts 
and techniques work best with a range of clients. It requires knowledge, skill, art, 
and experience to be able to determine what techniques are suitable for particular 
problems.  It  is  also  an  art  to  know  when  and  how  to  use  a  particular  therapeu-
tic intervention. Although reflecting on your personal preferences is important, I 
hope that you balance your preferences with evidence from the research studies. 
Developing a personal approach to counseling practice does not imply that any-
thing goes. Indeed, in this era of managed care and evidence-based practice, your 
personal preferences will not likely be the sole determinant of your psychotherapy 
practice. In counseling clients with certain clinical problems (such as depression 
and  generalized  anxiety),  specific  techniques  have  demonstrated  their  effective-
ness. For instance, behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, 
mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy,  and  short-term  psychodynamic  therapy  
have repeatedly proved successful in treating depression. Your use of techniques 
must  be  grounded  on  solid  theoretical  constructs.  Ethical  practice  implies  that  
you employ efficacious procedures in dealing with clients and their problems, and 
that you are able to provide a theoretical rationale for the interventions you make 
in your clinical work.
This is a good time to review what you have learned about counseling theory 
and practice. Identify a particular theory that you might adopt as a foundation 
for establishing your counseling perspective. Consider from which therapies you 
would be most inclined to draw (1) underlying assumptions, (2) major concepts, 
(3)  therapeutic  goals,  (4)  therapeutic  relationship,  and  (5)  techniques  and  pro-
cedures.  Also,  consider  the  major  applications  of  each  of  the  therapies  as  well  
as  their  basic  limitations  and  major  contributions.  The  tables  presented  in  this  
chapter are designed to assist you in conceptualizing your view of the counseling 
process.
Concluding Comments
At the beginning of the introductory course in counseling, my students typically 
express two reactions: “How will I ever be able to learn all these theories, and how 
can  I  see  the  differences  among  them?”  and  “How  can  I  make  sense  out  of  all  
this information?” By the end of the course, these students are often surprised by 
how  much  work  they  have  done  and  by  how  much  they  have  learned.  Although

an introductory survey course will not turn you into accomplished counselors, it 
generally provides the basis for selecting from among the many models to which 
you are exposed.
At  this  point  you  may  be  able  to  begin  putting  the  theories  together  in  some  
meaningful way for yourself. This book will have served its central purpose if it has 
encouraged you to read further and to expand your knowledge of the theories that 
most caught your interest. I hope you have seen something of value that you can use 
from each of the approaches described. You will not be in a position to conceptual-
ize  a  completely  developed  integrative  perspective  after  your  first  course  in  coun-
seling theory, but you now have the tools to begin the process of integration. With 
additional study and practical experience, you will be able to expand and refine your 
emerging personal philosophy of counseling.
Finally, the book will have been put to good use if it has stimulated you to 
think  about  the  ways  in  which  your  philosophy  of  life,  your  values,  your  life  
experiences, and the person you are becoming are vitally related to the caliber of 
counselor you can become and to the impact you can have on those who estab-
lish a relationship with you personally and professionally. This book and your 
course  may  have  raised  questions  for  you  regarding  your  decision  to  become  a  
counselor.  Seek  out  at  least  one  of  your  professors  and  explore  any  questions  
you may have.
Self-Reflection and Discussion Questions
1. What are the four major approaches to psychotherapy integration? 
How can these routes to integration be useful for you in designing your 
perspective on counseling?
2.
 In feedback-informed treatment, clients provide reactions to their expe-
rience of the session and to the therapist. How open do you imagine 
you would be to hearing honest feedback from your clients about you 
as a therapist and about the interventions you are making? Do you 
see yourself as being able to engage in a discussion with your clients 
regarding both their positive and negative reactions to a session?
3.
 In developing your integrative approach to counseling, what factors 
would you most consider?
4.
 What importance do you place on research that seeks to identify what 
makes psychotherapy work?
5. If you had to select one theory that would serve as your primary theory, 
which theory would you select and why?
Where to Go From Here
In  the  DVD  for  Integrative  Counseling:  The  Case  of  Ruth  and  Lecturettes  (Session  9,  “An  
Integrative  Perspective”)  you  will  view  my  ways  of  working  with  Ruth  by  drawing  
on techniques from various theoretical models. I demonstrate how the foundation 
of my integrative approach rests on existential therapy. In this session I am drawing 
heavily from principles of the action-oriented therapies.

Case Approach to Counseling and Psychotherapy (Corey, 
2013b)  illustrates  each  of  the  11  contemporary  
theories  by  applying  them  to  the  single  case  of  
Ruth. I also demonstrate my integrative approach 
in counseling Ruth in the final chapter. This book 
also  is  designed  to  fit  well  with  the  DVD  for  Inte-
grative  Counseling:  The  Case  of  Ruth  and  Lecturettes 
(Corey, 2013c).
Integrating Spirituality and Religion into Counseling: A 
Guide to Competent Practice (Cashwell & Young, 2011) 
offers  a  concrete  perspective  on  how  to  provide  
counseling  in  an  ethical  manner,  consistent  with  a  
client’s  spiritual  beliefs  and  practices.  The  authors  
help  practitioners  develop  a  respectful  stance  that  
honors the client’s worldview and works within this 
framework in a collaborative fashion to achieve the 
client’s goals.
