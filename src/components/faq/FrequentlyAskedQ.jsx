      question: "Who is Brighter Beyond for?",
      answer: "Brighter Beyond is here for anyone experiencing mild emotional distress, feeling overwhelmed, or simply needing a safe space to talk. Research shows that compassionate conversations can be just as effective as traditional therapy for those seeking support and understanding.However, if you're looking for structured counseling, therapy may be a better option.

      question: "What Brighter Beyond is Not?",

      question: "Peer Support or Therapy - Which One is Right for You?",
      answer: "If you're dealing with deep-rooted mental health concerns, therapy is the best choice. A licensed therapist can provide structured, long-term support tailored to your needs. Therapy can take weeks, months, or even years, depending on your journey. Peer support, on the other hand, is ideal for immediate emotional distressâ€”when you just need someone to listen. It's instant, anonymous, and always available to help you process your thoughts in the moment. ðŸ’™"

    {
